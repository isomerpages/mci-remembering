**Our Logo**

![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/mci.jpg) The dynamic green brush stroke, an evolution of the logo of MCIâ€™s predecessor, conveys engagement in public communications and outreach to all sectors of our society to support a well-informed and connected society. The wave of the logo symbolises riding the wave of innovation in the info-communications, library, media and design sectors to offer our people a better quality of life. Balanced on the top of the wave is a bold red dot representing a vibrant Singapore.
