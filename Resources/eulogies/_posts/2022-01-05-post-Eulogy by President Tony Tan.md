Friends and Fellow Singaporeans

On behalf of all Singaporeans, my wife Mary and I convey our deepest condolences to Prime Minister Lee and the family of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew on Mr Lee’s passing.

Today, Singapore bids farewell to our country’s first Prime Minister — the founder of our modern Republic. As a nation, we mourn a man who made a difference. A man who shaped our very identity as a society. A man who was devoted to ensuring that Singapore succeeded when no one thought we could.
