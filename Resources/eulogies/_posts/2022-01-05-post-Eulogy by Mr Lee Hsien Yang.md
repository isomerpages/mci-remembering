Mr President

Prime Minister and members of the Cabinet

Distinguished guests here to honour my father

My fellow Singaporeans and friends of Singapore

Singapore has lost the father to our nation. For my family we have lost our beloved father and grandfather. We are bereft.

I was born in 1957, and for as long as I can remember, Papa was a public figure. As a child, I was only vaguely aware that my father was an “orang besar” or “VIP” in Malay. All little children must think their fathers are special; I do not remember when it dawned on me that he was not just my own special father and not just an ordinary “orang besar”, he was an extraordinary “orang besar”.
