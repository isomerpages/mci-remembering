#### Eulogy by Mr Li Shengwu at Cremation Service
Honoured guests, friends, and family.

When the grandchildren were very little, Ye Ye would take us on walks to feed the fishes at the Istana. We would perch on the edge of the pond, the ripples of our breadcrumbs breaking the mirrored surface of the water. He liked to have the grandchildren nearby as he rode his stationery bike on the green grass.

Sunday lunch with Ye Ye was an institution for our family. His voice and his hearty laugh would carry to the childrensâ€™ table, talking about matters of state, recounting meetings with foreign leaders whose names we neither recognized nor remembered.
