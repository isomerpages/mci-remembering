#### ESM Goh Chok Tong’s Eulogy
<center><b>TRANSCRIPT OF EULOGY<br>
BY EMERITUS SENIOR MINISTER GOH CHOK TONG<br>
AT THE FUNERAL OF THE LATE MR LEE KUAN YEW<br>
SUNDAY, 29 MARCH 2015<br>
UNIVERSITY CULTURAL CENTRE AUDITORIUM</b></center>

HE WAS MY TEACHER

Mr Lee Kuan Yew gave his life to us. To truly appreciate this, you had to have marched alongside him in his long political journey. Or studied him closely – his words and actions, his ideas and vision, his values and philosophy. Or carried along by his passion in building a nation and improving the lives of Singaporeans. Or lived his worries, day in and day out.

To Singaporeans, he was our first Prime Minister, our leader who fought for our Independence, the man who turned Singapore from Third World to First, our national father. For me, he would always be my teacher.
