#### Eulogy by Mr S Dhanabalan 
<center><b>TRANSCRIPT OF EULOGY<br>
BY S. DHANABALAN<br>
AT THE FUNERAL OF THE LATE MR LEE KUAN YEW<br>
SUNDAY, 29 MARCH 2015<br>
UNIVERSITY CULTURAL CENTRE AUDITORIUM</b></center>

As one who worked closely with Mr Lee Kuan Yew for a period I just want to focus on just four aspects of his leadership that remain with me.

First, he had an absolute obsession to ensure an honest, corruption free political process and public administration system. He had seen the damage a nation and society suffer when well-meaning leaders allow those close to them to take advantage of their position. Mr. Lee demanded and expected honesty and probity from political colleagues, from his equivalent of “Long March” comrades, public servants and from all members of his family.
