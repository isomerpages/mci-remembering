#### Eulogy by Ms Cassandra Chew
<center><b>TRANSCRIPT OF EULOGY<br>
BY CASSANDRA CHEW<br>
AT THE FUNERAL OF THE LATE MR LEE KUAN YEW<br>
SUNDAY, 29 MARCH 2015<br>
	UNIVERSITY CULTURAL CENTRE AUDITORIUM</b></center>

I did not know Mr Lee Kuan Yew personally for most of my life. We met while I was on two assignments as a journalist â€“ documenting his life at home and collecting photographs for a picture book for his 90th birthday.

I met him up close six times, for meetings and interviews, from July 2011. Most were large, formal meetings at the Istana. Naturally I was on my best behaviour.

After all, this was the man who had led Singapore to independence, triumphed over his opponents in a storied political career spanning over 60 years, and transformed a sleepy colonial outpost into a bustling metropolis. And there he was, in person.
