From 8.00pm on Saturday, 28 March 2015, newcomers would no longer be admitted to the queue to enter the lying in state at Parliament House. Those who are currently within the queue would still be able to do so.

Since the opening of the lying in state at 10.00am on Wednesday, 25 March 2015, about 415,000 (as of 6.00pm) members of the public have paid their last respects to the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Additionally, more than 850,000 people (as of 6.00pm) have visited People’s Association’s (PA’s) 18 community sites located across Singapore.

“Live” coverage of the State Funeral Procession from Parliament House to University Cultural Centre (UCC), and State Funeral Service at UCC on Sunday, 29 March 2015 will be available on national television and radio, as well as online at www.rememberingleekuanyew.sg and
www.facebook.com/rememberingleekuanyew.

Members of the public are encouraged to line the State Funeral Procession route from Parliament House to UCC. Public service officers from agencies located along the route will be lining the streets to pay their final respects to the late Mr Lee. This includes Singapore Police Force bagpipers who will play Auld Lang Syne as the Gun Carriage passes by Cantonment Complex.

As part of the State Funeral for the late Mr Lee, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) will sound the “All-Clear” signal twice, through its network of Public Warning System (PWS) sirens, as a rallying call for everyone to observe a minute of silence together. This is a first by the SCDF and signifies the nation’s deepest respect
for our founding Prime Minister. Upon the first sounding of the signal, members of the public are encouraged to begin observing the one minute of silence. The second sounding will signify the end of the minute of silence.

Across the island, Singaporeans can jointly observe the minute of silence at PA’s 18 Community Sites and 105 Community Centres. Singapore Armed Forces servicemen and Home Team officers will also be observing the minute of silence. At the two land checkpoints, all persons and vehicle checks will be stopped to observe the minute of silence. The Funeral Service will also be broadcast at Changi Airport, libraries and hospitals for staff and visitors to participate in the one minute of silence.

In addition, prior to the minute of silence, all MRT trains will pull to a stop at stations and open their doors. Similarly, buses scheduled to depart from bus interchanges or terminals will be held back during the one minute of silence. Passenger Information Displays in the MRT network and bus interchanges will show “One minute of silence for Mr Lee Kuan Yew”. Announcements will also be made at stations and onboard trains.
