The traditional mounting of the vigil guards during the lying in state period symbolises the highest form of respect accorded to the deceased. It comprises four uniformed officers each standing at a corner of the casket with his head bowed, back turned away and ceremonial sword inverted. The vigil guards will be led by a senior officer, who will stand at the head of the casket facing inwards.

The Chief of Defence Force, Lieutenant-General Ng Chee Meng; Chief of Army (COA), Major-General Perry Lim; Chief of Navy (CNV), Rear-Admiral Lai Chung Han; Chief of Air Force (CAF), Major-General Hoo Cher Mou; and Chief of Staff, Joint Staff, Brigadier-General Chia Choon Hoong will perform the first vigil guard duties in the morning of 25 Mar from 9.45 a.m. to 10.15 a.m. That same afternoon, the Commissioner of Police will lead senior officers from the Singapore Police Force in performing vigil guard duties. On subsequent days, COA, CNV and CAF will lead their respective Services in performing the vigil guard duties.

Friends and former colleagues of the late Mr Lee will also hold vigil in his memory during the lying in state at Parliament House. They will be joined by representatives from various branches of government, trade unions, grassroots organisations and other groups, a reflection of his extensive and diverse contributions to nation-building.

Each vigil group, comprising about 20 persons, will hold vigil for 30 minutes. There will be a break of either 30 minutes or an hour between the vigil groups. The schedule of vigil groups for 25 Mar is below.
