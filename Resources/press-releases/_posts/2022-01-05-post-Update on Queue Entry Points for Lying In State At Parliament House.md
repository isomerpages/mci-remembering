From 7am, 26 March 2015, members of the public who would like to pay their respects to the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew lying in state at Parliament House should note that the queue to enter Parliament House will begin at the Padang. The public is advised to take public transport.

There will be a special lane at the Padang for the elderly, pregnant women, families with children under 6-years-old and those with special needs.

In view of the large crowd, a long waiting time can be expected. We seek the understanding of members of public to remain orderly and be patient, and to follow the directions of the marshals on the ground. Ground personnel will be distributing water to those waiting in line.

Updates on the queue waiting time will continue to be provided on an hourly basis.
