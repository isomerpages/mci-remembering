From today, the red box used by the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew as his briefcase will be displayed at the National Museum of Singapore, as part of the memorial exhibition In Memoriam: Lee Kuan Yew.

Minister for Education Heng Swee Keat wrote about the box in a Facebook post on 24 March 2015. The box had been used by Mr Lee to carry and store files and papers that he was working on at any one time, until 4 February 2015, the day before he was hospitalised. Minister Heng noted that the red box was a key feature in Mr Lee’s life and a symbol of Mr Lee’s unwavering dedication to Singapore.

The box is displayed together with other personal items used by Mr Lee, including his barrister wig after he was admitted to the Bar, and the Rolex Oyster Perpetual watch presented to him by the Singapore Union of Postal and Telecommunications Workers. Following the exhibition, the red box along with other personal objects and parts of the memorial exhibition will be incorporated into the Museum’s permanent galleries.

In Memoriam: Lee Kuan Yew is open daily from 10am to 8pm at the Glass Atrium, Level 2, National Museum of Singapore until 26 April 2015. Admission to this exhibition is free for all visitors. Hardcopies of the exhibition text in all four languages – English, Mandarin, Malay and Tamil will be available from Saturday, 4 April 2015 for visitors to take home.

Since it opened last week on 25 March, over 14,000 people have visited the exhibition. In addition to the exhibition, visitors can visit the Museum Label shop to purchase books on Mr Lee’s life.
