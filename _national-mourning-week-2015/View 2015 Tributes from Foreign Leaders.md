## View 2015 Tributes from Foreign Leaders

#### ASEAN Secretary-General, Le Luong Minh
ASEAN Secretary-General Le Luong Minh joined other world leaders in mourning the loss of Lee Kuan Yew, the first Prime Minister of Singapore, who passed away yesterday at 91. In a letter addressed to Lee Hsien Loong, Prime Minister of Singapore and son of Lee Kuan Yew, Secretary-General Minh conveyed his “deepest condolences” on the passing of the late Prime Minister.

In his letter, Minh described Lee Kuan Yew as “a great statesman who had built Singapore with his vision, wisdom and courage.” The ASEAN Secretary-General also acknowledged the late Prime Minister as one of those “instrumental in the establishment of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations” in 1967. Singapore is one of ASEAN’s five founding members and together with the other leaders, he has provided guidance to ASEAN in its formative years.
For three decades, Lee Kuan Yew dedicated his life to the success of his country and is widely recognised as the architect of Singapore’s transformation from a small port town 50 years ago to one of the world’s wealthiest countries. Secretary-General Minh noted that the late Prime Minister “has left a lasting legacy not only for Singapore but also for ASEAN and he will be greatly missed.”

#### Defence Minister of Indonesia, General (Retired) Ryamizard Ryacudu
“Every time I came for a meeting with the Singapore Army, he would definitely invite me for talks. I was shocked the first time. I was only the Army Chief. He was more senior than the prime minister. But he wanted to speak to me – not once but five times,” said General (Retired) Ryamizard.

“I regard him as a true statesman. He did not discriminate against anyone. He spoke from the heart and I responded likewise. He was sincere in his views. And I responded with sincerity. We understood each other,” he added.

General (Retired) Ryamizard likened his discussions with Mr Lee to those between a father and son. He said Mr Lee’s honesty and sincerity laid the foundation for good ties between Indonesia and Singapore’s armed forces.

“We must talk to each other, whatever the issues may be. There’s nothing hidden, because we know he is sincere, forthright. The rest of us followed the same,” said General (Retired) Ryamizard.

“From earlier on, Indonesia and Singapore conducted joint military exercises annually. The two armies took turns to host. Similarly, for the air force and navy. It has been going on well. That’s a result of the foundations laid from the top. That’s how it was between Mr Lee and President Suharto,” he added.


#### EU Ambassador to Singapore, Dr Michael Pulch
p>I wish to express my heartfelt sympathy to his family and the people of Singapore for the passing away of Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

He was an inspiring statesman whose vision of an independent and prosperous Singapore became the foundation of its lasting success.

Throughout his political life generations of European leaders did seek his views and advice to better understand dynamics in this part of the world. He will be deeply missed.

– Dr Michael Pulch, EU Ambassador to Singapore

Saya menganggap Bapak Lee Kuan Yew sebagai sahabat dekat dan saya tahu bahwa beliau adalah sahabat sejati Indonesia.

Setiap pertemuan saya dengan Bapak Lee Kuan Yew selalu memberikan pelajaran berharga bagi saya. Ia adalah sosok yang bijaksana dan wawasannya mengenai hubungan internasional sangat luas.

Semenjak saya menjabat sebagai Presiden Republik Indonesia, saya telah bertemu beberapa kali dengan Bapak Lee Kuan Yew. Di setiap pertemuan tersebut Ia selalu memberikan motivasi dan nasihat yang tak ternilai bagi kemajuan Indonesia.

Bapak Lee Kuan Yew dikenal sebagai salah satu Kepala Negara yang sangat dihormati di Asia.

Sebagai salah satu pendiri ASEAN, Bapak Lee Kuan Yew telah menjadi tokoh penting dalam transformasi Asia Tenggara menuju komunitas dinamis yang damai seperti saat ini.

Bapak Lee Kuan Yew akan selalu dikenang tidak hanya oleh masyarakat Singapura, namun juga masyarakat Indonesia dan Asia Tenggara.

Semoga Almarhum dapat beristirahat dengan tenang.

PS. Our deepest condolences to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his family on the demise of Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
God bless,

Forever and always, I will always be grateful to Mr Lee Kuan Yew for what he has done for Singapore. It is not easy to have given up his life for Singapore but yet, that was what he did. He gave his all to build up Singapore to where she is today. I am thankful to be a Singaporean, to be living in a clean and green state, to have a shelter over my head, to experience quality education and to have all our basic needs met and more.


In a short span of 50 years, he has achieved so much for Singapore. Singapore is nowhere near how it was 50 years ago. It has grown exponentially into the first world country we are all privileged to live in today. This, I attribute it to Mr Lee, who had the foresight and more importantly, the strong determination to develop Singapore. He never gave up despite the odds. He could have but he did not and all his life, he gave his all to Singapore. It is also inspiring how he never gave up learning even when times were bad and uncertain. He is an amazing and inspirational man and no amount of words can express the gratitude I have for Mr Lee, our founding father. There are times when I wished I had the opportunity to say a simple ‘thank you’ to him when he was living.

The love story between Mr and Mrs Lee has also touched my heart greatly. Their love for one another is like none other. Photos of their younger days actually placed a smile on my face for I am glad that they had each other in their lives. But tears sprung to my eyes when I read about how Mr Lee was dealing with the passing of Mrs Lee. It was an unimaginable period for Mr Lee then. I sincerely hope that they are finally reunited now.

Mr Lee Kuan Yew, you have made an impact in the lives of so many people. Though you are no longer here with us, one thing is for sure, you will never be forgotten. I will always remember you and continue to share your stories with future generations to come. We are here because of you, because you held on and never gave up.

Thank you, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. May you rest in peace now.

Dear Sir
I write this message with a heavy heart mixed with a satisfaction that you have lived a full life.


The world will not see another leader as strong & powerful as you. What you have left behind for us is uncountable. A Corruption free nation, a red passport that requires minimum visas across the world, a country that is safe for a girl to be out at 2am, a very clean & green nation, roof over our heads, ensuring the needies are taken care, etc. the list can go on….. All these are not possible without your guidance & excellent leaders.

We will not despair but will celebrate your legacy. Your leadership will be carried on by your ministers. You are a Good Samaritan & we will be your shadow in this Nation.

I stand proud to be a Singaporean & that is because of you & your sacrifices. We will miss you but you will live in our hearts forever. We will speck your legacy live with the coming generations. It’s now time for you to rest MR. Lee, the giant of the little red dot. You will always be our guardian angel.
Kohila Subramanian

To the family of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
My deepest condolences to the family.


I really Thank God that I am born in Singapore. Thank God that Mr Lee had given his all for Singapore. Without him, Singapore wont be where she is now. We are just a small dot yet we are influential and being recognized internationally for our progression.

I want to thank Mr Lee for building up a clean and green Singapore. Every 20 steps we take there will be trees shading us from the sun. Singapore is also a safe country, I know I am safe even I am out late at night. Mr Lee had also focus so much on education, without knowledge we would be forever a 3rd world country.

Thank you Mr Lee, for what you have sacrifice for the people of Singapore. May you rest in peace.

Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s last words to me were: “”Think over it carefully, then you ask me the question the next time we meet.”” (ST, 6 Sep 2011)


But it was not to be. That student forum at NTU marked his last appearance on such a platform.

I will always cherish the little conversation we had. Even though it was somewhat confined within the formalities of a dialogue session, I could feel a personal touch when Mr Lee responded to my question on policies for a more equitable Singapore.

His smile. His chuckle. And gentle jab at the end. Like a stern grandpa.

I have never agreed with his views on welfarism or integration of Malay/Muslims in Singapore. But such differences should not stand in the way of recognising Mr Lee’s undoubtedly special place in the history of our nationhood.

My condolences to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Mdm Ho Ching and the Lee family at this difficult time.
Muhammad Farouq Osman

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
Thank you for all that you have done and accomplished, together with your team, which has resulted in the Singapore that we have all come to love and enjoy.


Nothing brings me pride whenever I have the opportunity to return to Singapore from an overseas trip, and the words “”Welcome Home”” appear at the immigration counter back.

The clean, efficient and safe place that we know as Singapore, which is our home, where we have our roots, family, friends and everything else that we hold dear is a place where the foundations were laid strong.

Without this strong foundation, we would not have the opportunity that we all have today, to build on what has been accomplished. We are also equipped with the necessary skills, together with the wisdom and direction from our past experiences, now able to achieve more for the future of our country.

Thank you for all that you have done, for all your thoughts and decisions which always had the best for all of us in mind.

Rest in peace, Sir, and may you watch over us as we forge the path ahead into the future.

To our founding father, Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


I am deeply grateful for your undying love and dedication to us your children, Singaporeans.

You have given us shelter, education, jobs, security and to be able to have an equal footing in society. To date,no one in my opinion, as done so much for a country, that he had to give up his entire lifetime just to shape a third world fishing village to a world class country.

On your passing, I am reminded of our NDP song truly, which reminisces on your sacrifice for us. This verse of the song reminds me of the struggles and tribulations of your strength.

“”When there are troubles to go through
We’ll find a way to start anew
There is comfort in the knowledge
That home’s about its people too
So we’ll build our dreams together
Just like we’ve done before
Just like the river which brings us life
There’ll always be Singapore””

As sadness overcome us upon your passing I pray that you will rest in peace, do know that we are in good hands. We will keep you alive in our memories.

Thank you for everything, no words can gratify for what you have done. I will continue to teach my children of your legacy.

Dear Mr Lee,
Your conviction and commitment to our nation inspires us to do more for our homeland. Your work speaks louder than our encouragement to those who wish to throw in the towel. You made many people think, “”How can I give us so easily?””, “”How can I better serve Singapore?”” and “”How can we be better Singaporeans?””


Your leadership brought us from nothing to what we have today; from being a rural country with almost no hinterland to a thriving metropolis; from being threatened to having deterrence and letting people know that it will hurt to hit us; from diverse communities to a gelled and orderly community who can proudly call ourselves Singaporeans than by our racial makeup.

Those who refute this are in denial.

Many people, young and old, have learnt or are reminded about things we have taken for granted throughout this week. It is a wake up call to many. Thank you, Sir, for still serving Singapore even after you leave us.

Your demise is our loss. But rest assured that the foundation that you and your team has laid will not be in vain – we will make sure that our country will be much better by the time we leave this world, no matter how small.

This is how we will honour what you and our pioneers have done.

My condolences are with your family. Hope they will be able to tide through this tough times.
Yours sincerely,Alaric Leong

Dear Mr. Lee, our great Founding Father,


THANK YOU, from the bottom of my heart. No amount of words can express my deep gratitude for all that you have done.

I have always grown up proud as a Singaporean. When I was young, I didn’t know why. I just knew I felt proud when I was watching National Day parades, and the crowd cheered when you arrived at the stadium. When I grew up and began to understand more about my country, I begin to understand. Singapore had humble beginnings. We all worked hard, and we thrived under your leadership, your guidance, your determination and many more that I probably can’t name it all. Most of all, I think it’s because of the love you had for our nation and it’s people, that we can now be living in a prosperous, safe and comfortable country, that many others admired.

This week, I found myself sharing with my 3 young children a lot more about Singapore’s history and you and your party’s contributions, and as they found me weeping everyday over the loss of Singapore’s founding father, they began to understand why they are so fortunate to be born and living in Singapore.

What we can do now is to carry on the legacy you left behind, continue to work hard and thrive, ensure Singapore progresses in the international arena, and bring our children up well so they too can continue the legacy, and ensure Singapore continues to shine.

My family and I never fail to watch the National Day parade. This year, we will miss you dearly, and we forever will. But that doesn’t stop us from watching it year on year, as it’s also a time when we reflect and appreciate all that we have. And all that you have done for us.

Thank you, for giving us this beautiful nation. We will continue your work for Singapore.
With lots of love, Eileen Nah and family

Dear Mr Lee,
When I heard about your demise on Monday, tears flowed naturally. The nation has lost its founding father and it is hard to come to terms with it. I watched the the history of how you brought Singapore to independence and to what it is today, I am deeply touched, with admiration for your grit and dedication to this country.


We have learnt much from you, your perseverance and foresight as a country leader; your unwavering love for Mrs Lee as a husband. When Mrs Lee was bedridden, you never failed to read to her each night. When you were hospitalized, you worked tirelessly. Even when you were very sick, you put others above yourself. These are possible because you cared for your people, your loved ones . You have touched the lives of many which can be seen from the endless stream of people coming to say Goodbye to you the last few days. You have inspired and gave hope to the many who think the impossible. Most importantly, you gave us a safe and comfortable place we called home.

Mr Lee, as said, ‘Singapore is your life’s work’ and you know, we Singaporeans can never thank you enough. We will keep your spirit alive and ensure that the generations to come honor your legacy by contributing and making Singapore a better place to live in.

It is time for a well-deserved rest with you loved one, Mr Lee. May you and Mrs Lee be blessed in Heaven.
Alice Goh

Mr Lee Kuan Yew, a man who defied all odds to build a nation we proudly call home today.

I believe words alone are insufficient to truly express the extraordinary feats the man has achieved.

But if one would to just take a glance across the spectacular skyline of Singapore, while reminding himself that this was a third world country not very long ago, he would certainly be struck by the greatness of the man, the man we affectionately address as Father.

This week, the nation and the world mourn the passing of this great man.

Thousands and thousands of people from all walks of life have come together to pay their last respects and express their deepest gratitude towards the man who devoted his whole life to our nation. The endless queue of people outside the Parliament House clearly shows the special, irreplaceable place he has in the hearts of Singaporeans across generations.

As we Singaporeans come together to mourn the loss of our Father, we are truly united as One People, One Nation, One Singapore. As I waited outside the Parliament House, I saw Singaporeans helping one another, volunteers distributing packets of tissue, refreshments and umbrellas. There were also many heart-warming stories shared through social media, and I feel deeply touched by all these little gestures.

I am sure Father would be very pleased.

I hope that this spirit would continue, and we shall stand together stronger and more resolute to continue the legacy of our Father.

“At the end of the day, what have I got? A successful Singapore. What have I given up? My life.”

Thank you, Father.
Kenneth Teoh

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
We are greatly indebted to you for spearheading the transformation of Singapore from the scratch to the current modernised and reputable city in the whole world.


We are gifted to get you as the leader of our young nation. Being the architect of Singapore, you have carefully shaped the country and made it recognised by the whole world. With your visionary instinct, you have worked tirelessly to materialise your visions for the progress of Singapore and for the well being of the people.

We are extremely sad with your parting. Whoever comes to lead our country after your lifetime, no one, absolutely no one can replace you. Nevertheless, the new leaders will definitely follow your footsteps and take Singapore to the next lap.

Your stern leadership with care and concern for the people of Singapore has been admired by all Singaporeans. All the people in Singapore love you deeply. Although you have left us physically, you will always stay in our heart and mind. Thank you very much sir for giving us this wonderful, peaceful, stable and secure life in Singapore.

Sir, please rest in peace.
Tharmilarasan s/o Nagan

Thank you Mr. Lee Kuan Yew for all that you’ve done for this country; for all the sacrifices you’ve made. You’ve made it such that I’m proud to call myself Singaporean anywhere I travel to, proud to display my red passport and proud of defend my own country when ill words are spoken.


Your life work has resulted in people around the world being able to distinguish Singapore from the rest of the region. When asked by others where I’m from, I always respond with pride that “”I’m Singaporean”” despite having lived overseas for over a decade. This level of pride is all because of what you’ve done to make what Singapore is today and what Singapore as a country stand for.

We have no doubt lost a great leader, a Titan. But rest in peace knowing that your work will see more Singaporeans stepping up, more leaders being created and more leaders striving to be like you.

Rest in peace Mr. Lee Kuan Yew.
Jessie Goh

I came migrated to Singapore as a 10 year old in 1970, together with my family. I’ve considered myself a Singaporean since and renounced my Malaysian citizenship at the age of 21.


I was a product of a country that offered peace, stability, HDB flat ownership for most families, almost free education for all and jobs for everyone. Yet, in my 20s, with my university education I still was not able to understand the vision, determination and hard work of Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his team to bring us that far. I saw a comfortable if not luxurious life full of possibilities. Therefore, I chaffed at the reins of what I felt was a patriachial PM who wanted to control every little decision its citizens made. I found many of his policies and pronouncements infuriating. Why was he was always talking about survival and how Singapore needed to keep working very hard to survive in those seemingly difficult times?

Reflecting on Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s legacy, I realized I had progressed from 1-room rental flats when I first came to Singapore, to a 4-room flat and after marriage an executive maisonette and finally to a freehold condominium. My family and I have not done too shabbily.

It must have really been tough for Mr Lee to share his vision with people who could not understand him. Yet, he persevered, sticking to what he thought was right for Singaporeans and cajoled, pushed and literally dragged us from Third World to First World status in less than 50 years.

In this past week, it is obvious that everyone has hindsight. But I do not know of anyone with the vision, clarity, tenacity and incorruptibility of Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Yes, he was patriachial but he was like that even with his own family and he loved Singaporeans like he loved his own family and only wanted us to not only survive but prosper on this Little Red Dot.

Thank You Mr Lee Kuan Yew for dedicating your life to building a Singapore we’re proud to call home.
Fang Mei Ling

from the bottom of my heart…..
My dearest father Lee Kuan Yew, it is so painful to say good-bye to you. You have done so much for us Singaporeans, for whom you have sacrificed your life. If not for you, we will remain as a small dot in the world and nobody would have noticed us. It is because of you that the whole big world is talking about this small dot that is called Singapore. You made the world turned in our direction with admiration. You made every citizen of other countries to yearn for a leader like you. Such is the admiration you get from all around the world. You gave us recognition and respect. Wherever we go in the world we are well received and respected. All these will never be true if not for you. I grew up in a poor family where basic necessities were of questions. But today my kids are living in much comfort. You made education for all compulsory and took away from us all poverty and misery. All these will never be true if not for you. You made opportunities for us to come up in our life and made a difference in each and everyone’s life. I can’t thank you enough Sir Lee Kuan Yew. 50 years ago you cried for Singapore when it was separated from Malaya. Now 50 years later, Singapore is crying for you. How I wish you were immortal but god made you mortal. Now time as come to say good-bye to you. My heart is very painful and my tears doesn’t stop rolling. Good-bye my dear father. You will always be immortal in our memory. Thank you my father for teaching us the great qualities of a great man. God bless your great soul and your family. Love you very much Sir. Rest in peace Mr Lee Kuan Yew!!
Kala Kalaithasan

Dearest Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
In your presence you touched our lives, in your passing you stirred our hearts!


Your accomplishments requires no further elaboration through words because they are facts and truths.

Thousands of miles away from home, knowing what thousands are doing and feeling back home, reading the thousands of words being expressed in The Straits Times everyday, I am afraid a thousand words will not express my thoughts and sentiments now.

But I wish to tell you this. In this week of national mourning, I have become convinced that we do have a Singapore Spirit. It is one that is the personification of you; Disciplined, determined, truthful, hardworking, desire to learn, improve oneself continuously and more.

With this Singapore Spirit, I believe that Singapore will have many good years to come.

So, may you rest in peace.

Yours respectfully,
Lim Kee Hua

It is difficult to add to the various tributes already published about this great leader of ours. As a Singaporean PR I have been amazed at what this great leader has achieved for the nation and fellow Singaporeans. I believe Mr. Lee was one among few truly visionary leaders in this world. He was a tough and fair leader driven by a deep personal vision to build Singapore to a world class nation and to provide fellow Singaporeans a life of opportunity comparable with the best in this planet. He achieved both in his lifetime and leaves behind a strong and stable legacy . He will be missed by all of us deeply in this world and I salute him, his sacrifice and dedication, and pray for his soul.
K B Ravindranath Menon

Dearest Mr Lee, Founder of Singapore,
No words can describe my sadness on your departure.
You possessed all the traits of a great leader, in fact much more.
It was your undivided and selfless love that make brings this country to what it is today.


For the past few days, I have learnt more about you through the interviews on television programmes and articles I read in the newspapers. You and your team have built and transformed Singapore into a world class nation, well regarded by the world despite we being just a small little red dot in the world map. Singapore’s success will not be possible if not for your hardship, perseverance and toil that you have gone through and overcome during those difficult years.

You are a role model to all and will be dearly missed by all Singaporeans. Please continue to guard and watch over us in wherever you are. May you rest in peace and be reunited with Mrs Lee.
Goodbye Mr Lee, you will always have a place deep down in my heart.
Lee Sheue Yiuh

To the Singaporean’s beloved Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
Leaders over the world admire and envy us for having such a remarkable founding father. Some even said that Singaporean do not know how to appreciate and feel without gratitude for having such a brilliant leader that have built our nation.

From the day when Mr Lee KY’s passing was announced till the funeral procession’s day, thousands of people were deeply saddened, their sympathy and wanting to pay the last respect attitude during these few days was touching. What can people prove? l believed that every Singaporean knows when and what to respond.

To the majority, Mr Lee KY is not just the first prime minister of Singapore, they even described him as a mighty guardian that sent by God. His journey may have ended on 23 March 2015, but his legacy will lives on. Mr Lee KY is the legend of Singapore.

Thank you Mr Lee, for dedicating your whole life for Singapore that’s we now called home. I’m not a well educated person or a rich entrepreneurs . I am just a ordinary family man. But if there comes to a day where Singapore goes to a war, what I can contribute to our country is to protect her till my dying breath.

One thing for sure ,there are still many Singaporean who are willing and ready to sacrifice for this island city when time has come.

I hope that the government would declare 23 March as a holiday for all future generations Singaporean to remember this great legend of the century.

Farewell Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
Gary Wee

Many Australians share a profound respect for Mr Lee and revere his courage, dignity, profound wisdom and nation-building acumen. We consider him a friend of Australia and many of us wish he was one of our own. Many years ago, he warned us that ‘Australians would become the poor white trash of Asia’ unless economic reform was instituted – a remark which stung Australian politicians to action. To call yourself a ‘mate’ is one thing; however only the very best friend of all will tell you when you are on the wrong path. We say that he was a very great friend indeed.

痛失一位这么勇悍，富责任感，具远见和智慧的领导者，心情实是无比哀痛。然而沉溺在深深的哀悼时，别忘了回报他最好的方式是好好地生活，力求种族和谐，社会安定和继续发展。


让我们一起向这位一代巨人深深地鞠躬，因为有他，才有现在的新加坡!

别忘了人家是建立一个家庭，而李先生不只建立一个家庭而且还建立了一个国家! 我们应该把沉痛的心，忆念他的心，转化成力量，竭力把现在的新加坡维持下去或甚至打造得更完美! 我相信这样，李先生他会很高兴的。
安息吧！我们的建国总理李光耀先生。
您会永在怀念中。

Dear Mr Lee,
Your legacy never dies because to live in the hearts of your people and the first rate nation that you built – is to live forever. Your contributions and personal sacrifices will remain unmatched for decades. We owe an unspeakable debt of gratitude for the epitome of service before self, for your wisd


Rest in peace.
JM

Dear Mr Lee, a simple thank you is not able to express the gratitude we have for you. Without you, there won’t be a Singapore today. Along side with the pioneer Singaporeans, you have built a safe, clean and fair country for our children. As long, you work hard you will be treated fairly and have a chance to be successful.


When I drive to work yesterday, I saw the flowers along ECP are all blossomed beautifully which is a sight I never seen before. As if it’s saying good bye to the gardener of Singapore, Mr Lee Kuan Yew!

Thank you Sir for everything. May you rest in peace!
Jacky

Thank you for making Singapore as what it is today. Without your tremendous effort in helping out with Singapore’s economy, Singapore will not be as advanced and as beautiful. Thank you for sacrificing your entire life just to help Singapore to be a better place for Singaporeans and foreigners to live in. Your ‘Plant a tree campaign’ helped Singapore to be clean and green and Singapore owned the title, “”Garden City””.


Mr Lee Kuan Yew also pursued in Singapore’s education system, to allow every Singaporean child to have the opportunity to be bilingual, therefore, resulting in the Lee Kuan Yew bilingual scholarship.
Thank you for all your wonderful contributions and striving so hard just to make Singapore a better place. Now, all your hard work, tears and sweat have all paid off.
Once again, I would like to say a sincere and grateful thank you to you, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the Founding Father of Singapore. I am very proud to tell others that I am Singaporean and I can call Singapore my home.

饮水思源

Yours sincerely,
Valentina Tan

I’m sorry that I couldn’t make it to the Parliament House to pay my respects personally. Instead, I’ve went to one of the community sites instead. I hope you don’t mind that..


No amount of thank you can suffice the contributions and sacrifices that you’ve made for this nation that I’m proud to call Home. But still, Thank you Sir. You’ve worked so hard for Singapore, thinking about her for every living breath you’ve had. You were selfless, placing Singapore above anything else. You’ve been a great inspiration to many of us, and I’m sure you will continue to be for the future generations.

It has been extremely heartwarming to see Singaporeans queuing to pay their last respects for you, and the kindness from my fellow Singaporeans. And Sir, this is all because of you. Growing up, I’ve always thought of Singaporeans as selfish and un-united. But they’ve proven me so wrong, and I thank you Mr Lee, for uniting us Singaporeans once again.

You’ve done so much and it’s time to take a break. As much as my heart is heavy with sorrow, I’m also glad that you’re free from pain and suffering, and that you’re finally reunited with your love of your life. Thank you too, Mrs Lee, for without you, Mr Lee would be a different person, and Singapore might have not been how she is now. I hope that both of you can continue to watch over us from wherever you are, and know that because of the strong foundation that you’ve given us, we will make Singapore shine even brighter than she is now on the world map.

Thank you and Rest in Peace Sir.
Yijun

Rest in peace esteemed Mr Lee Kuan Yew. i am deeply saddened by your passing. With your passing, it has created a void in Singapore and the hearts of all Singaporeans. But it will be filled with a fond memory of you and all that you have done and fought all your life for Singapore to be what it is today. For that we are eternally grateful. Today as always,I stand proud to be a Singaporean. Anywhere we go we reply with pride that we are from Singapore and with the equal pride when people from all walks of life and country acknowledge with envy what Singapore stand for.


Blessed are we Singaporeans to have had you to guide us and lead us through the times. Even with your passing, your spirit lives on. We will never forget.

In Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s own words: “You begin your journey not knowing where it will take you. You have plans, you have dreams, but every now and again you have to take uncharted roads, face impassable mountains, cross treacherous rivers, be blocked by landslides and earthquakes. That’s the way my life has been.”

“”But we are not an easy-going people. We cannot help thinking, calculating and planning for tomorrow, for next week, for next month, for next year, for the next generation. And it is because we have restless minds, forever probing and testing, seeking new and better solutions to old and new problems, that we have never been, and I trust never shall be, tried and found wanting.’””

With heartfelt gratitude, thank you esteemed Mr. Lee Kuan Yew. Rest in peace.
Toh Jia Song

Dear Mr Lee,
Since the day you left us, I have watched so many videos of your younger days when you did your rally speeches. I have watched how you fought for the independence of Singapore and have admired your conviction and determination in building up a nation. I am deeply touched whenever I witness your devotion for Mrs Lee. You are so much more than I thought I knew about you.


Thank you, Mr Lee. Thank you for your years of hard work and commitment in building this nation. Everything that we are enjoying now, is the fruits of your labor.

I have been thinking these few days on how I can best pay tribute to you, to thank you for all that you have done. I guess the best way that I can possibly do, is to promise you that wherever that I might be in the years to come, I will still come back to Singapore, the nation that makes me proud, the roots of my identity and the home where I belong.

Just yesterday, my friend asked me all of a sudden, whether will I leave Singapore and migrate to another country for retirement. I told her, “”never”” I will not leave behind a nation which is built on tears and sweats by our forefathers. I promise to treasure Singapore and all that has been built for us.

May you rest in peace. You will forever be in my heart and the hearts of our fellow Singaporeans.
Eve

Dear Mr Lee,
I am nine this year. Mummy and Daddy took me to the p.house to see you. But I only see Singapore flag. Mummy told me that is you.


You have built a nation so so pretty. I love all the flowers in the park. Big kisses and thank you

Dear Mr Lee,
We have not met each other,but you have managed to touch my life in many ways.without Yew,Singapore will not be Singapore today.My life is through the hard works of yours.
Ah gong,thank you for your sacrifice what you have done are for this nation,for the people in Singapore.I am proud to be a Singaporean. You may lay your burden down now. Singapore will miss you with love and admiration.


Miss you forever
MK.Low

I am who I am today, a proud and grateful Singaporean, because of you.
My father was an ardent supporter and my mother a quiet admirer. The rest of us in the family were devotees. Yes, in many ways you were our supreme guide and we believed in you.
You did not fail us.
Your dynamism, dedication, deep sense of duty, brilliance and discipline are few of the many virtues that we were in awe of and, in our modest ways, tried to emulate.
My family and I will forever be grateful to you for sacrificing yourself for our nation.
In the next karmic cycle, I wish to be somewhere close enough to you to be able to serve you. In the meantime, a part of you will always be with me.
Here is a virtual farewell hug…which may displease you, but what the heck, you are our father – the father of Singapore.
See you soon .
Saraspathy Menon

Dearest Mr Lee,
You are a remarkable and respectable leader that made a difference during tumultuous times. We are glad and grateful that we have you as our founding father. Your dreams, convictions, dedicated lifelong service had changed an unsightly fish village into a pleasant, safe and peaceful country, a bustling and cosmopolitan city where we are proud to call home.

Under your remarkable leadership with you team, leading a group of elite and hardworking fellow mates, people of young generations are the beneficiaries of the fruit of your labour. Without you making a difference during the tumultuous times, travelling to different destinations, Singapore won’t be what it is today.

Although you have left us, your legacy, passion and perseverance will live on forever. We are grateful and honoured to be part of the generations where we witnessed your remarkable leadership. Though you won’t be able to witness the changes with us, we know that you are watching over us at your new home with Mrs. Lee.

50 years ago, you shed tears for the nation. 50 years later, the nation you have dedicate your life shed tears for you. You brave through challenges in building a nation, you walked till the end of your journey bravely despite all circumstances. Nothing stands your way is what I have witness through days of mourning. It clearly shown that you have touched the lives of people you accounted for, Singaporeans from all walks of life and even across island wide.

Thank you for all the sacrifices you made for us, your dedicated lifelong commitment and contributions to Singapore. No amount of words can expressed our heartfelt gratitude. You have left a great assets to the Singaporeans of generations. Thank you for everything, for what you have done for the nation, the people you are accounted for. You’ll be deeply remembered in our hearts, our founding father. May you rest peacefully and reunite with Mrs. Lee in your new home.

Thank you Mr. Lee for your dedicated lifelong service to this nation and provide a safe and low crime home for people you accounted for.
Our humbled deepest condolences to Mr PM Lee and family. May you and your family brave through all challenges in life. Thank you for letting us, Singaporeans grace the final journey of late Mr. Lee with you.
With heartfelt gratitude,
Anson Lim, Lina Yeo, Serene Ong, Katherine Kraylene.L, Eileen Ng

I’ve never actually really thought about this… It seemed to me as though Mr Lee Kuan Yew would live on forever and the news of his death hit me like a freight train when I first read about it on my way to school on Monday morning.
His death was inevitable, but deep down, I was desperately hoping that he would hang in there, at least until the 9th of August, to celebrate SG50 with all of us. Now, though, I am a touch comforted by the fact that his suffering has ceased, and that he has reunited with his wife.
He was a magnificent man and Singapore will never see a man and leader as marvellous as Mr Lee Kuan Yew. He was truly a great leader who gave his all for his country, who made Singapore what it is today. Without him, there’ll be nothing. To this man who made it all happen, thank you so much. Your contributions were tremendous to say the least, your love for the country was amazing, your dedication to Singapore, all your efforts, your blood, sweat and tears… We thank you from the bottom of our hearts and we will not let you down; we will continue to make Singapore shine, prosper and flourish. I hope as you look down at us from the skies, you’ll be proud of us. We’ll keep your legacy alive and every Singaporean, no matter present or future, will know your name, your great deeds, and carry on the legacy.
Tiffany

You led Singapore in times of adversity and poverty. You gave your time and life to transformed a sleepy hollow into a global metropolitan. You crafted policies and developed Singapore using your model. You made the little red dot known to everyone from the East to the West. You worked relentlessly for the future of your people. You had been ostracized and condemned for your style. You never succumbed to criticism and rivals. You led your way and did your best for your homeland.


You deserve my utmost respect and deep admiration. Mr Lee Kuan Yew, thank you for being a wonderful statesman. Rest in peace

Mr Lee is Singapore personified. With his passing, an era of possibly a golden era for Singapore.


Born in 1962, I grew up as Singapore grew from a GDP of slightly higher than $500, highest in SE Asia, to over $55,000, one of the highest in the world. I experienced how it was like to be in the third world to first.

Singapore and Singaporeans owns a great debt to men of the calibre of Lee Kuan Yew, Goh Keng Swee, Toh Chin Chai, S Rajaretnam, Lim Kim San, Devan Nair, Hon Sui Sen, and many of the founding fathers. As PM, LKY is the first of the founding fathers. Without them, their patriotism and committment, Singapore is most likely to be a bleak dark dot, instead we have become a bright red dot.

Due to my work, I had been to many countries, least developed or developing nations – Jamaica, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, Sudan, Nepal, Mozambique, Mauritius, Maldives, South Africa, Panama, Colombia, Papau New Guinea – all developing nations.

Some of these, had higher GDP than Singapore, in the sixties.

One vivid ocassion was in Sri Lanka.
I read that Sri Lanka or then Ceylon, was considered a pearl in the Indian Ocean, clustered in a relatively area of peace, unlike Singapore, then battling the communist red tide in S E Asia. Sri Lankans have the bright people. Alas, racial strife wrecked the country for over 30 years.

After a presentation on Singapore’s TradeNet, a Sri Lankan gentleman came to me and thrust me a book he had written.

It was about LKY and what he had done in Singapore, and lessons for Sir Lankans. He expressed profusely about LKY, and I was bemused and slightly embarrassed.

I didn’t yet, fully appreciate that Singapore could have been like Ceylon, if not for the wise policies of multi-racism and bilingualism of Lee and the Old Guards.

As a Singaporean, I did not benefit of all Singapore had to offer. I did not have a benefit of a university education in Singapore, no thanks to the education policies. My gratitude for my university education goes to Australia.

However, LKY’s Singapore provided a conducive environment for me to find jobs and earn a living for myself and my family. The golden era of Singapore in the last 50 years is such, that I did not find emigrating to larger countries like Australia, or the US, enticing. I choose to stay in Singapore, because no where is better or as comfortable as my Singapore home.

Thank you Mr Lee, without you and the Old Guards, your abiding passion for Singapore, had given us this golden era we had in the last 50 years.

I only hope that your younger successors in the Government, and the PAP will have the same kind of indomitable spirit, and the abiding passion for Singapore, to lead Singapore to a even golden era for the future generations of Singaporeans.

Your ‘Plant a tree campaign’ helped Singapore to be clean and green and Singapore owned the title, “”Garden City””.


Mr Lee Kuan Yew also pursued in Singapore’s education system, to allow every Singaporean child to have the opportunity to be bilingual, therefore, resulting in the Lee Kuan Yew bilingual scholarship.
Thank you for all your wonderful contributions and striving so hard just to make Singapore a better place. Now, all your hard work, tears and sweat have all paid off.
Once again, I would like to say a sincere and grateful thank you to you, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the Founding Father of Singapore. I am very proud to tell others that I am Singaporean and I can call Singapore my home.

Yours sincerely,

I’m sorry that I couldn’t make it to the Parliament House to pay my respects personally. Instead, I’ve went to one of the community sites instead. I hope you don’t mind that..


No amount of thank you can suffice the contributions and sacrifices that you’ve made for this nation that I’m proud to call Home. But still, Thank you Sir. You’ve worked so hard for Singapore, thinking about her for every living breath you’ve had. You were selfless, placing Singapore above anything else. You’ve been a great inspiration to many of us, and I’m sure you will continue to be for the future generations.

It has been extremely heartwarming to see Singaporeans queuing to pay their last respects for you, and the kindness from my fellow Singaporeans. And Sir, this is all because of you. Growing up, I’ve always thought of Singaporeans as selfish and un-united. But they’ve proven me so wrong, and I thank you Mr Lee, for uniting us Singaporeans once again.

You’ve done so much and it’s time to take a break. As much as my heart is heavy with sorrow, I’m also glad that you’re free from pain and suffering, and that you’re finally reunited with your love of your life. Thank you too, Mrs Lee, for without you, Mr Lee would be a different person, and Singapore might have not been how she is now. I hope that both of you can continue to watch over us from wherever you are, and know that because of the strong foundation that you’ve given us, we will make Singapore shine even brighter than she is now on the world map.

Thank you and Rest in Peace Sir.

Dear Mr Lee, a simple thank you is not able to express the gratitude we have for you. Without you, there won’t be a Singapore today. Along side with the pioneer Singaporeans, you have built a safe, clean and fair country for our children. As long, you work hard you will be treated fairly and have a chance to be successful.


When I drive to work yesterday, I saw the flowers along ECP are all blossomed beautifully which is a sight I never seen before. As if it’s saying good bye to the gardener of Singapore, Mr Lee Kuan Yew!

Thank you Sir for everything. May you rest in peace!
Jacky

Rest in peace esteemed Mr Lee Kuan Yew. i am deeply saddened by your passing. With your passing, it has created a void in Singapore and the hearts of all Singaporeans. But it will be filled with a fond memory of you and all that you have done and fought all your life for Singapore to be what it is today. For that we are eternally grateful. Today as always,I stand proud to be a Singaporean. Anywhere we go we reply with pride that we are from Singapore and with the equal pride when people from all walks of life and country acknowledge with envy what Singapore stand for.


Blessed are we Singaporeans to have had you to guide us and lead us through the times. Even with your passing, your spirit lives on. We will never forget.

In Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s own words: “You begin your journey not knowing where it will take you. You have plans, you have dreams, but every now and again you have to take uncharted roads, face impassable mountains, cross treacherous rivers, be blocked by landslides and earthquakes. That’s the way my life has been.”

“”But we are not an easy-going people. We cannot help thinking, calculating and planning for tomorrow, for next week, for next month, for next year, for the next generation. And it is because we have restless minds, forever probing and testing, seeking new and better solutions to old and new problems, that we have never been, and I trust never shall be, tried and found wanting.’””

With heartfelt gratitude, thank you esteemed Mr. Lee Kuan Yew. Rest in peace.
Toh Jia Song

Dear Mr Lee,
I am nine this year. Mummy and Daddy took me to the p.house to see you. But I only see Singapore flag. Mummy told me that is you.
You have built a nation so so pretty. I love all the flowers in the park. Big kisses and thank you
Janet Lim

While reading through the condolences, I’m reminded of a couple of lines from Paulo Coelho’s Aleph:

“”Words are tears that have been written down. Tears are words that need to be shed. Without them, joy loses all its brilliance and sadness has no end.””

Was struck by the profound connection between words and tears. The many tributes have contained words of gratitude towards our founding father, while eulogies by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his brother Lee Hsien Yang have certainly struck a chord in the hearts of those who have loved and lost. The tears of those grieving speak volumes of the immense respect for MM Lee Kuan Yew.

I’ve been very touched by the eulogies. MM Lee Kuan Yew has led a sparkling life and the anecdotes that were shared showed a softer side, a side that all of us can relate to, a side that we’ll fondly remember.

My heartfelt prayers go out to Prime Minister Lee’s family. Know that our thoughts are with you during this difficult time.
Maggie Chen

Dear Mr Lee,
Since the day you left us, I have watched so many videos of your younger days when you did your rally speeches. I have watched how you fought for the independence of Singapore and have admired your conviction and determination in building up a nation. I am deeply touched whenever I witness your devotion for Mrs Lee. You are so much more than I thought I knew about you.


Thank you, Mr Lee. Thank you for your years of hard work and commitment in building this nation. Everything that we are enjoying now, is the fruits of your labor.

I have been thinking these few days on how I can best pay tribute to you, to thank you for all that you have done. I guess the best way that I can possibly do, is to promise you that wherever that I might be in the years to come, I will still come back to Singapore, the nation that makes me proud, the roots of my identity and the home where I belong.

Just yesterday, my friend asked me all of a sudden, whether will I leave Singapore and migrate to another country for retirement. I told her, “”never”” I will not leave behind a nation which is built on tears and sweats by our forefathers. I promise to treasure Singapore and all that has been built for us.

May you rest in peace. You will forever be in my heart and the hearts of our fellow Singaporeans.
Eve

Dear Mr Lee,


We have not met each other,but you have managed to touch my life in many ways.without Yew,Singapore will not be Singapore today.My life is through the hard works of yours.
Ah gong,thank you for your sacrifice what you have done are for this nation,for the people in Singapore.I am proud to be a Singaporean. You may lay your burden down now. Singapore will miss you with love and admiration.

Miss you forever
MK.Low

I am who I am today, a proud and grateful Singaporean, because of you.
My father was an ardent supporter and my mother a quiet admirer. The rest of us in the family were devotees. Yes, in many ways you were our supreme guide and we believed in you.
You did not fail us.
Your dynamism, dedication, deep sense of duty, brilliance and discipline are few of the many virtues that we were in awe of and, in our modest ways, tried to emulate.
My family and I will forever be grateful to you for sacrificing yourself for our nation.
In the next karmic cycle, I wish to be somewhere close enough to you to be able to serve you. In the meantime, a part of you will always be with me.
Here is a virtual farewell hug…which may displease you, but what the heck, you are our father – the father of Singapore.
See you soon .
Saraspathy Menon

Dear Mr Lee,
When the whole world doubted we will survive, waiting for us to fail, you proved to them that Singapore can survive without natural resources, without merging with our neighbour, without colonial power.


You further proved to the world, that Singapore can grow and prosper, and do better than her neighbours that are many times bigger in size, population, and resources.

You united and inspired the people of Singapore to work hard for our survival, to be resilient and undaunted.

You reminded us not to be complacent with our achievements, but to stay ahead of competition.

You were not afraid to implement unpopular policies that will do good to the nation.

You upheld the country’s integrity and dignity by keeping it corruption free and not allowing other countries to tell us how Singapore should be run.

You built a country that is strong and free, that we call Home, that we are proud of.

With Mrs Lee, you have taught us true love and devotion to a long-lasting marriage.

You taught us the core values of upbringing our next generation.

Your lifetime contributions to Singapore are beyond what words can describe. We have so much to learn from each of them.

You have worked hard for your entire life for Singapore and her people.

You can finally rest and be reunited with Mrs Lee.
Thank you for all your teachings, Mr Lee.

You will be dearly missed by the people of Singapore.
Lynn Hwee

Being born in the 90’s, by then I had a stable home to live in, clean water to drink and bath in, a good education system. I had no idea what poverty was till I got older and saw images of people from Africa having to both drink and bath using mud water. It was then that I felt very very lucky to have been born and raised in Singapore.


From being a newly independent country back in 1965, I am amazed at how you, Sir, has stepped forward to lead and transform us from a third world country to first world with your courage, foresight, determination, and firmness within a short span of time. How big of a role you must have played for us in the international stage too.

I may not have met you before, you may not have impacted my life directly, but it feels as though I’ve lost a grandfather if I may say. You have done a tremendous amount of things for your people, your country, for your entire life. There will never be another magnanimous man like you again.

I hope you’ll have a good rest now, thank you very very much, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
Huiting Zuraidah

You led Singapore in times of adversity and poverty. You gave your time and life to transformed a sleepy hollow into a global metropolitan. You crafted policies and developed Singapore using your model. You made the little red dot known to everyone from the East to the West. You worked relentlessly for the future of your people. You had been ostracized and condemned for your style. You never succumbed to criticism and rivals. You led your way and did your best for your homeland.


You deserve my utmost respect and deep admiration. Mr Lee Kuan Yew, thank you for being a wonderful statesman. Rest in peace

Kevin

Dear beloved Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


I regret that I only get to know so much more about your sacrifices, thoughts and concerns for Singapore after your passing.

Your passion, tenacity and decisive actions have helped Singapore overcome its darkest moments and challenges through the last 50 years. Your farsightedness has given us a stable and able government; a capable team of younger leaders to carry us through the next chapter of the Singapore story.

No amount of words or actions can fully express my heartfelt gratitude. Please accept this as a small token of my appreciation. Your fearless fighting spirit will continue to live on.

Rest in peace Mr Lee.
Danny Kwok Wai Chung

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


We have been truly blessed as a nation to have benefited from your strong foresight, leadership and governance. You shouldered tremendous responsibility in steering Singapore to economic excellence and gave us all a sustainable home. My generation has been so fortunate – we did not live through the tumultuous times, but the lessons learnt will be deeply etched in my mind and for this I am eternally grateful.

We will continue to champion your spirit of excellence and make you proud of us for generations to come. I am so proud to call myself a Singaporean and I will tell my future children all about what you have done for Singapore. Thank you for first believing in us. God bless you and your family.
Kong Yi Ling

Dear Sir,
It is with a heavy heart that I am writing this. I have not had the chance to meet you in person. The closest distance between us was when I paid my final respect to you at the Parliament House.


Our founding father, I would like to say “Thank You, Sir” from the bottom of my heart for dedicating your life to Singapore. From a third world country to the first, those tough decision and leadership that you have to make, our clean water, garden city, home ownership, and many more… Without your dedication to build this little red dot, Singapore will not be what it is today. You have definitely made a huge impact not only to all Singaporean but to the world. We are blessed to have you as our leader. I am proud to be a Singaporean and we will unite to continue your legacy.

I am also deeply moved by your love for Mrs Lee and am glad that you now can now be reunited with her.

Rest in peace, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. We will miss you deeply and you will live on, deep in our hearts always.
Elaine Tang

Dear Mr Lee,
I thank God as He has blessed Singapore with a visionary leader that love this country and willing to give his whole life to build this a better place for generation after generation. As I travel very often, Singapore is always the only place I feel like home. Even as I’m married to a British person, and grant me a good opportunity to change my citizenship but this has never been my thoughts as I’m proud to be a Singaporean.


It is definitely our great loss of your departure but we can see that your final days, you had brought the entire Nation closely together as one Singapore. In addition, we can see publicly declare your contributions via social media were overwhelming and once again remember your contributions to this country.

May the comfort and peace of God with Your family and once again I thank you for what you had done and I had been so much interested in Singapore history because of you.
Serene Lee

Farewell, Mr Lee Kuan Yew

…… The Founding Father of our Nation;

….. the Founding Partner of our Firm.

+++

We join the multitudes to mourn the physical loss of your comforting presence.

You gave your best to lead us to achieve so much in your illustrious and long life. Your eminence as the guiding light and moving inspiration was not just for our nation but also the international and global stage!

Your exemplary, indomitable and sacrificial spirit in demanding excellence first from yourself, even as you lead and demand from others around you, has galvanized and made Singapore to what it is. You gave your life… but the past few days have shown that even in death, your spirit lives on to galvanize and move the multitudes for good!

We are proud that the same spirit of excellence and integrity by which you established Lee & Lee with your fellow founding partners, has been entrenched through the past 60 years into our hearts, our hopes, and our aims.

No one like you shall pass our way again… but we shall be forever grateful and humbled that we are direct beneficiaries of your legacy as our rich heritage.

On our part, we shall persevere with dedication, inspired by all that you are and have left for us.

Rest in Peace… Mr Lee Kuan Yew

“Though nothing can bring back the hour of splendor in the grass, glory in the flower, we will grieve not; rather find strength in what remains behind.” – William Wordsworth

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
Me and my family was deeply saddened when we hear about the news on Monday of you passing away. We offer our deepest condolences to Mr Lee’s family as losing a family member is never easy. 50 years ago you have cried for our country and all of us, now we will mourn and cry for you as we have lost one of the best leader of Singapore. We have always been thankful that we lived in Singapore as it has been a safe and clean country and it is all thanks to you that our country has been in this way.

Many thanks to Mr Lee for giving all of your entire life into building Singapore up from a 3rd world country which was a village to a 1st world country which is now a Metropolis City. It is because of your all your blood, sweat and tears that everyone in Singapore gets to live a enjoyable life with all the necessities required.

Singapore is a miracle that you have created. You have created a place whereby many of us can live peacefully. Thanks to your leadership and all of your efforts that all of this is possible for all of us. I am sure that every Singaporeans will be very proud for having Singapore as their home and having you as our founding father of our home. Even though Singapore does not have any natural resources to build up, we have one good leader that lead us and stand up for our country and this is even better than having those natural resources.

Many new generations will not know how much sacrifices you have made to build this country to where it is now. One of the world wealthiest and most developed countries. They also wont know what is it like to live in a 3rd world country and the sufferings. Many of us take things for granted and only express our thoughts when it is too late. But Mr Lee, thanks to you that the new generations won’t have to go through those sufferings.

No words can ever express our gratitude to you for everything that you have given up for our country and for all fellow Singaporeans. We are blessed to live in Singapore, the fruits of your labour. Your legacy will be carried on by all Singaporeans and the memory of you will continue to live and be respected in our hearts. Let Singapore be all Singaporeans burden from now on and we will shoulder it and continue to bring the country to greater heights. May you rest in peace and God bless you.

Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, it is with a great sense of gratitude that I paid my final respects to you in the wee hours of 26 March 2015.


The beauty, orderliness and cleanliness of modern Singapore owe their beginnings to you and the capable team that you assembled in our early years.

Empowered with vision, you saw the potential of modern Singapore and worked tirelessly towards building a nation that we are now proud to call our own.

Your strength as a leader has not gone unnoticed by our neighbours or the international community. It was this strength that galvanised a people of diverse backgrounds and beliefs. It is this strength that won you the respect of your people and those around you.

Leadership is, indeed, no easy task. Despite much opposition, you made difficult decisions, many of which you believed were for the good of our island nation. Many of these decisions turned out to be the correct ones. Of course, being as human as the rest of us, there is no doubt that mistakes were made. Some policies were unpopular and some actions were controversial. Nevertheless, it is my belief that these were outcomes that were already weighed and discussed. It is inconceivable that a man blessed with such foresight would not imagine the results of his words, actions and decisions.

Mr. Lee, I believe that you did the best you could with what you had and I am immensely appreciative that we had a leader who was as courageous as you even in the toughest of times. Thank you, Sir, for trailblazing us to where we are today.

Though I have not known you in person, I know that your heart and soul were devoted to the rise of modern Singapore. Though I have not seen you in person, I see the vision you had all those years ago in the fruit of your labour all around me. Though I have not heard you speak in person, I have witnessed the gravitas and power of the words that you have spoken.

In your passing, we are deeply grieved at the loss of one of our great founding fathers. Thank you, Mr. Lee, for all that you have done for us. You have served this nation with your life – a life that will be forever inscribed in the annals of history, never replaced, never forgotten.
Remus Zhong

Sir,
I was born in the 60s when you made Prime Minister. My family and I lived in a kampong in Poh Huat Road, off Upper Serangoon Road. As kids growing up, we felt the impact of every policy you made such as Speak Mandarin Campaign, Housing Policy, 2 is enough, etc.. We cared less about the impact of your policies because we were more interested in flying kites, catching birds and fishing in the ponds. Sometimes, we would listen to the adults as they gather to talk about your plans for our neighbourhood and the country. My grandfather was a civil servant then and he would leak some information about the Government plan. As kids, we sat there listening and watching the reaction of the elders. Some were angry especially with regards to the land acquisition act. Some were elated to hear that they could finally have a proper home to live in. As you can imagine, kampong houses back then were made of attap and zinc roofs, wooden beams and walls (infested with termites) and erratic electricity supply (especially during rainy days when the overhead power cables would snap because a branch fell on it).


Today, as I look around me, I understand why you had to do what you need to do. I see the fruits of your labour. Some of your policies were hard to stomach but we trusted you and you delivered. For that, we will forever be grateful. You have done your job and you paid for it with your life. Nobody will ever come close to achieving what you have done. Nobody can ever emulate you. Whenever I see videos and pictures of you, one word comes into my mind; style. That’s right, style. The way you carried yourself, interact with higher dignitaries, communicate with people from all walks of life, understanding their needs and passion, being firm and even ferocious when needed, sympathetic and caring to those around you and jovial at the right time are qualities which resonates with me.

As an ex-Naval Officer, you were also my Commander-in-Chief. If you had shouted ‘charge’, you can be sure a thousand sailors will set sail and defend this country with our lives. This is our home which you have built for us and anybody who tries to take it away from us will feel the might of our guns and missiles. This country is truly worth fighting for.

As you proceed to your final resting place, I want you to know that your ship is in good hands. The Command team has proven themselves and the morale of the crew is high. There will be some slackers but don’t worry, we will sort them out! Bon Voyage Sir Lee Kuan Yew, you were the best Commander any officer can work for. Pipe the still……
Gabriel Tan

Receiving the Prime Minister’s Book Prize in 1984 was one of the high points (if not the highest) of my school days. As I join fellow Singaporeans in saluting Mr Lee, I look back in wonder, not just at that honour I had received from LKY himself, but also at his foresight in establishing the policy on bilingualism.


It is often said that we must give our children both roots and wings. In a way, that is what bilingualism has done for Singaporeans. Our mother tongue keeps us rooted in our culture, while English serves as a portal to the wider world – in effect, giving us wings. I look back in wonder and respect as this was just one of many things he set in motion with his astounding foresight.

Anyone can dream, but it takes someone special, with extraordinary courage and determination, to translate that dream into a vision, and galvanise an entire nation to march with him to realise that vision. That march, though glorious, has undoubtedly been a long and difficult one.

Rest in peace, Sir.

With deep and abiding respect
Jareena Salih

It is saddening to wake up to the news of passing of Mr Lee Kuan Yew on the morning of 23th March 2015. On that very day, the whole of Singapore became very silent. I was on the train to work at SGH and the whole journey was quiet and reflective. Everyone in the train was quiet, solemn and you can see some who are upset. Upon reaching SGH, I took a longer detour toward the Quad outside SGH Blk 7 and see a couple of visitors shedding tears. It was indeed a saddening day for the whole nation because we have lost a great man who have built Singapore from nothing to what it is today.


It is sometimes we don’t realise that our country is beautiful, clean and safe until we lose it. We can actually feel it everyday. For example, walking on the streets at 3am and you know that you will be safe. Moreover, we can see the lush greenery that spread out throughout the streets of Singapore including the trees opposite my house are blooming with flowers of white and pink colour.

Your dedications to make Singapore better over the last 50 plus years has shown results and I totally appreciate that. It is your leadership and capabilities to work with your team that brought us to what we are today. I am thankful and blessed to have you as our founding father. No words or actions can compare to what you have done for this country. You will be always be in my heart and in every hearts of every Singaporean.

Thank you Mr Lee, without Yew, there is no us.

Rest in peace, Mr Lee! I am sure that Singapore will be in good hands.

Majulah Singapura!
Then Tze Kang

To the greatest leader of all,
There are many great leaders that has written history, Mr Lee Kuan Yew is however the one that not only do I respect most, but also the one that all Singaporean owe most. Without Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s great fore sight, plans, strategies and belief in Singapore and our fellow country people, we will not have even achieved half of what we have today. From a small fishing village to a first world nation, under the leadership on one statesman, at the same time facing the challenge of no natural resources and many others problem, Mr Lee Kuan Yew has exceeded mankind expectation and limitation.


Thank you Mr Lee for shaping Singapore into what she is today so that each of us has a much better standard of living. I thank you sincerely with all my heart and I will always be proud to say that I am a Singaporean. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.

RIP Mr Lee,

Yours Sincerely,
Wong Wei Kai

I thank you from the bottom of my heart, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, for fighting courageously in the beginning for the independence and survival of Singapore; and for your wisdom in guiding the younger generations of leaders, both locally and internationally, to make Singapore and the world at large a more stable and peaceful place to live in.


You have made our little red dot larger than what it appears and for the whole world to recognise and respect us. I promise to try my utmost best to make Singapore a better place to grow old and die.

The outpouring of tributes for the past few days is befitting a man like you. You have demonstrated great compassion throughout your life, and to a Buddhist like me, this is a mark of a great being, a Bodhisattva.

Om Mani Padme Hum
Lee Liang Tee

Mr Lee Kuan Yew, thank you for your most dedicated efforts to bring Singapore to what our great home is today. You are truly an amazing man, who gave us hope for a better future at Singapore’s most desperate times in the 1960s and truly an excellent leader who brought us better days over the years.


50 years ago, Mr Lee, you brought us together as one united people
50 years later, Mr Lee, you brought us together again as one united nation.

Thousands complain about about the long queue at the parliament house, but still appear at that solemn place awaiting to pay their last respect, simply because hours of waiting nothing compare to the enormous contributions you made. In that hours of waiting, we all had a feeling of familiarity towards each other although many of us had never might each other before. There was this amazing feeling of connection and bond Singaporeans had but never realized.

50 years ago, Mr Lee, you stood before us, all Singaporeans had a common goal, a better tomorrow.
50 years later, Mr Lee, you lie before us, all Singaporeans have a common goal, to send our deepest appreciation and respect to you.

Mr Lee, you are the soul of the Singapore Spirit, you are the blood of Singapore’s veins, you are the father of all Singaporeans.

Thank you Mr Lee, because of you I am proud to call myself a Singaporean.
Davidson Chee

I thank you. I thank you for your efforts to shape Singapore into what it is today. Your hard work has paved the way for physically challenged people like me to come to Singapore and study, enjoy good transport and access most of the places in Singapore.


I first visited Singapore in 2006 on a medical trip. I was highly impressed by the infrastructure, cleanliness, and most of all the safety of this country. I remember telling my dad and mom, ‘I would like to live here one day.’ Two years later, my dad was able to secure a job – his dream of serving children with special needs – as an educational therapist at the Dyslexia Association of Singapore (DAS). I was ecstatic. From then on in 2008 until now, 2015, I have enjoyed every single minute that I have lived in this country.

Me Lee’s legacy has given birth to a fine nation. As a visionary and a great leader, he has excelled in creating a nation that through his nurturing hands, prospered. Once again I thank you Mr. Lee.
Mohamed Zimnaan

Dear Mr Lee,
Your passing comes at a poignant time as I did my national service for the last time this week. I find myself looking back a lot over the various great things that you have done for us through the years and the legacy that you have left Singapore with.


As an early 80’s 3rd generation Singaporean, I am a very fortunate beneficiary of the Singapore system, one which is based firmly on meritocracy, clean government and most of all, guided and moulded by your astute vision and strong leadership. For that, I am very grateful to you.

Yes, I have sacrificed the best time of my youth for the nation through national service but all of these are minuscule and nothing compared to what you have done for Singapore. Without you, I am very sure that Singapore will not be even close to what it is today.

I have not had the privilege to meet with you in person but yet know you dearly through the various policies that you and your government had and have implemented which impact me through my life. I am sure this feeling is something that most of this nation shares with me. Since your passing, countless Singaporeans from all walks of life and foreign leaders unite and come together to pay their last respects to you. I am deeply touched and really feel proud to be a Singaporean. You have truly created and united a very unlikely group of multiple ethnicities, races, religion and language together to forge a nation, one that is very prosperous one in a single generation against all odds.

You are truly a titan amongst men and a constant beacon of light to all of us Singapore for the past 50 years.

Thank you Mr Lee. May you rest in peace.
Eugene Jang

Dear Mr Lee,
I always wanted to meet you, and imagined such meetings where I am just awed with your words and the confidence you had for Singapore. You were indeed our father, you took on the burden and assured us with your words, your eyes, your smile, that all will be well.


Today, I met you as you lie in state. I cannot believe that I will not be listening to your voice, and seeing you at NDP. I am ever grateful to you and your team, for building Singapore. I am grateful whenever I walk out of my nice home, to my safe streets and well-structured roads. I am grateful when I see the Singapore skyline, the parks, and our airport. I am grateful.

Today, I move from being just grateful. I want to take actions, and do my part to ensure that your spirit and passion for Singapore lives on. That I do my part to protect the Singapore that has been created, and to improve on it further.

The queue to the Parliament House showed that I am not alone. Fellow Singaporeans, young and old are equally spirited and have the will in them to uphold your legacy.

Mr Lee, in your life, you created a Singaporean Singapore. In your death, you reminded us of being united, as one people, for Singapore, for you.

Thank you Mr Lee. May you Rest in Peace.

With Love and Respect,
Rafidah Rahumathullah

Dear Mr Lee
We may be a small red dot & have no natural resources or hinterland to fall back on but time & again under your wise leadership, we managed to survive & overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges.

Your constant concern & unwavering dedication to seek out opportunities to improve the lot of Singaporeans humble us & you have our utmost gratitude & respect & will always be Singapore’s hero & champion. Indeed Singapore is fortunate to have you as a leader

You are a giant among leaders and bear the mark of a true leader, providing assurance, clarity, vision & direction when the future is chaotic and uncertain.

Your dependability, drive, determination, integrity, foresight, perseverance, conviction, courage, passion, tenacity, single minded mission & devotion to Singapore’s well-being & welfare help create a free, safe, beautiful, vibrant, resilient country with a clean honest political system.

Thank you for establishing a meritocratic & multicultural society where there is equal opportunity for all to succeed so long as one is willing to work hard , regardless of race, language & religion,

Though we are sad by your passing but we are also glad & fortunate & grateful to have you as our leader, as our founding father. We appreciate all that you have done & all the sacrifices that you had to make for Singapore to be a success. .

I trust that you are in a better place. May you rest in peace.

Thank you
Wong Chau Peng and Family

Mr Lee sir, thanks for giving us a good nation to live in. As Singaporeans we are well respected by other nationalities because you have instill the discipline in us to grow from young, adult and become a mature human being. Without your tough but well-made rules and regulations, most of the young would have directed their respective life in a wrong concept. One good rule which you conceptualize was to make men serve National Service and to understand the purpose being a Singaporean, why there is a need for everyone to play their role to defend our nation. I admire you as a leader for making this happen.


Today our entire nation moans as you left us. We will still stand strong to defend this swamp which you turned into a concrete slab though the systems you have placed throughout these years. You have foreseen what we need for the next 50 years and how Singapore will be in SG 100. Hence we will fear none. We will continue to move forward as one nation.

RIP Mr Lee Kuan Yew sir, our founding father.

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yee,


Thank you for everything that you had done for Singapore!

I belong to the Millennials Generation, and because of you, I am able to live in a safe and secured environment with comfort, where I call home. Your belief in education and bilingualism will allow me to gain the upper hand when I step out into the industry in a few years time. With these, I am truly grateful to you.

A simple thank you will never be enough to repay your contributions to Singapore, but I believe by carrying on with your legacy and building a better Singapore will be the way to keep you proud.

I hope you are able to witness the bond between Singaporeans ‘as one united people, regardless of race, language or religion’ as we grief while keeping your spirit alive. I hope you’re proud of it and long may it continue.

Mr Lee Kuan Yew – A role model as a fighter, devoted husband and father, and the best prime minister.

May you reunite with your beloved wife, Mdm Kwa Geok Choo.
Gone but not forgotten, Rest in peace, Sir.

Dear Honorable Mr Lee Kuan Yew


I do not have enough words to express my heartfelt gratitude for what you have given us. You demonstrated courage, determination and compassion to build Singapore as it is today. We are nothing but the results of your sheer hardwork of a lifetime. Together with Mrs Lee, who stood by you in every decision and at every moment of your life, both of you have given us shelter we call home, education system to bring our country forward, clean water and a beautiful garden city. All this is made and created by you and your ideologies.

You gave world class infrastructure, a safe and secure home, equality and freedom to practice our culture and religion. You allowed us to speak our hearts and minds, but limited and restricted us, so that we do not hurt the sentiments of others. You took care of your citizens just like a family. You dedicated your entire life to build this nation. And i can only hope as Singaporeans, we put our best foot forward to uphold what the legacy you have left behind. You’re probably the last man of 21 Century who is deserving and worthy of all the respect of people and countries across continents. For generations to come, your stories will be told in many ways. History will remember you, Hearts will cherish you and future will respect you.

With all due respect, I salute you and wish you rest in peace. May you watch us from wherever you’re and feel proud of us in every way.

With Love and Respect,
Khusboo Kumari Pandery

I remember you as the affable man in white in his chauffeur driven car, smiling and waving to me and my friends as your car pulled alongside my mother’s at the Panggong Negara lights. My schoolmates and I were ecstatic. Even then, I knew who you were, but not quite. I understood more as I grew up and have always revered you as the man who gave Singapore the global respect and consideration it otherwise would not have received. Sure we all worked with you, do or die. You were a perfectionist who suffered no fools and we became like you, our founding father, who was always ready for a scrap. Through you, we can walk the world with our heads held high, proud of who we are and where we come from. We are welcomed everywhere we go because our reputation for orderliness, discipline, meritocracy and honesty precedes us. You were afraid that we might dismantle all that you’ve done, that we might not have the will and intellectual fortitude to do the right thing for Singapore. Well, you can rest now, on the assurance that your people have come out in their millions to tell you that they will not let you down. Wherever we may be in the world, we will carry our heritage with pride and work together to make Singapore a better place than when you left her. It was a pleasure knowing you even if it was for a fleeting moment. RIP Mr Lee.

Dear Mr. Lee Kuan Yew


When I heard you say that you had given your life to build a successful Singapore, I am very touched. Who is willing to give up his life for a cause such as this, if he does not care; do not believe at all and do not commit with his whole heart to persevere and work towards it, regardless of the cost and sacrifice he has to make.

I often wonder where and what I will be if I am not born in S’pore. I thank God that I am born in this nation especially when I see how blessed I am as compared to others. I am thankful that many people of your generation had contributed tremendously to the building of this nation that I can now call my home. It is my precious home indeed.

About our society, I am thankful that you have try to make us different, having and preserving good social and moral values. You want us to be a society with a big heart that cares for others. Thank you for the numerous self improved campaigns (that make Singapore so unique) and your strong emphasis on bilingualism. Thank you for being bold to implement them even when they attract criticism and grumblings because you believe it will be good for us at the end. Our society is definitely more cohesive and gracious now. And we can all have a good head start in life through exposure and good education provided for us, as long as we are willing to work hard. Thank you!

You are unique and I thank God for you. You have left your footprints in history. We will surely miss you!

Everyone is deeply saddened by Mr LKY’s departure. Although life and death is part and parcel of life, it still hurts big time and it’s tough to accept when it happens. Mr LKY is a great man, great leader, great husband and a great father to the whole nation. Without him, there will be no Singapore, no us and no place which we can all safely and comfortably call it home. Now that he has left us and resting in peace, he will not be forgotten. His contributions to the modern Singapore today will be remembered by all. As we mourn over the loss of this great man, we will stand united as SINGAPOREANS and further develop Singapore with his visions in mind. May you rest in peace.


Gone but never forgotten….
Halena Chua

Dear Sir,


We Singaporeans are mourning for the loss of you. For the past week my heart aches, throat tight and tears well up each time I see a report, article, picture or video of you…they are everywhere I go.

I have already known since I was little how much you have done to build Singapore into where we are today…I think somehow this has been ingrained in every Singaporean’s mind.

For the past week, I have learned much more of your many sacrifices, struggles, toils and contributions in developing Singapore, which I truly believe..with your best and only intention to give all Singaporeans a better tomorrow, a better life. I have also gained some insights into snippets of your daily life through interviews of your family, friends, staff and comrades. I have learned and touched by the soft side of you as a loving husband, caring father, thoughtful friend, demanding yet reasonable boss. I’m amazed by how simple and frugal personal lifestyle you have lived !

I especially admire your single-mindedness and courage to tiredlessly search and explore, consider and deliberate, decide, implement and see it through policies you think best for Singapore and its people, even though you knew that some may be unpopular policies. You knew that Singaporeans would realise and understand that this is best for us when result prove it. I think this kind of belief, spirit, attitude, determination and courage is what you hope for in the younger generation government, and that Singaporeans would continue to support and have faith in the present and future Singapore govt…I think this is one of your main concerns too.

I do have faith in the present govt, and I believe they would continue to do and give their best. So, thank you Sir, and rest in peace. You’re greatly, greatly missed.

Dear Sir,


A big bow and salute to you as a sign of my uttermost respect for who you are and what you have strived to make Singapore to be today. I am very blessed to be growing up during the times when you started out to ‘grow and develop’ our nation. You have set high standards for all Singaporeans to achieve and follow.

Though I now live abroad, I am always proud to say that I am a Singaporean and can hold my head high by what our nation has achieved. Though there were controversies in some of your policies and systems, we know that your intentions are always for the good of the nation. You were a man of integrity and you have lived your life standing by what you believed in and I truly respect you for that. As one who grew up and educated in Singapore, I am proud to say that some of the values that you have instilled in us as a nation are still the ones I have taken on as my values – to work hard and to achieve to a high standard of my abilities.

Your demise has stirred in deep emotions within me. As a nation, we are saddened by your passing. But I can truly congratulate you on the passions you have in this life on earth – a celebration of a life well lived; one of which is Singapore, and the other, your beloved wife and family, both of which you have succeeded in growing and loving.

Thank you for being such a great example to us as our founding father. My prayer is that Singapore’s current and future leaders will continue in your legacy to grow and ‘love’ Singapore with the integrity and steadfastness you have left behind. Both acts are certainly tough acts to follow.

Thank you also for the multiculturalism identity you have made Singapore to be which has enabled Singaporeans to be more tolerant of people of other races. This trait is definitely unique to Singapore and not many countries have this to show for.

To end this tribute, I would also like to extend my deepest condolences to Mr Lee Hsien Loong and the whole family for the loss of a loved one.

Let us all continue to pray for this nation that one man had set out to mould and grow into what it is today – a well known city all over the world.

‘Let all supplications, prayers, intercessions and thanksgivings be made for all people (of Singapore) , for kings (PM, Cabinet Ministers and leaders) and all who are in high positions, that we (Singapore) may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way.’ 1 Timothy 2:1-2

You are like the man as described in the Book of Proverbs 28:2 – ‘When a land transgresses, it has many rulers, but with a man of understanding and knowledge, its stability will long continue.’

May Singapore’s stability continue to reign with the legacy you left to your successors.

Rest in peace, Sir, You will always have a special place in my heart!

Love,
Suzanne Yap

Dear Mr Lee,

On May 13, 1969, when racial riots broke out in Malaysia, I was four years old. My parents were in Chow Kit Road, the scene of the heaviest rioting. They fled for their lives and, miraculously, escaped unscathed. Shaken, they moved my siblings and I, all five of us, the youngest barely a year old, to Singapore under the care of a guardian, while they remained in Malaysia. It was a tough but well-considered decision. And one they have never regretted.

Time and again, you would be the topic of conversation at dinner time in our household. My parents, in particular, were always full of praise for you. You were singular; a man of your time and beyond.

I am 50 this year. Singapore has been home to me for over 40 years. I married a Singaporean and have 3 children. You would be smiling approvingly if you were still around. Truth be told, there’s no better place in the world than Singapore to raise a family.

I just spent a short three grateful seconds gazing where you lay in Parliament House, bowing and uttering a short prayer. And then had to move on as thousands were waiting to do the same. It felt insufficient given the magnitude of your sacrifice.

On the way home, I overheard a little girl singing her version of “”Majulah Singapura””: “”Mari kita yaya Singapura, macam macam ma guru…”” I smiled, something I could not do much of in the past few days. I am certain she had no clue what she was singing about. But how befitting.

Indeed, “”onward proud Singapore, like a teacher…”” to many cities around the world with our model of sustainable and inclusive development.

Mr Lee, Singapore owes you an incalculable debt. We will always honour the memory of you and celebrate your life, one which you lived completely devoted to building this nation.

Rest in peace, Mr Lee.
Lorinne Kon

Go forward! Your Honour, your wise words are aplenty, but to me, after “”Merdeka””, Your exhortation to us to forge ahead relentlessly as the ONLY way for Singapore to survive and prosper will forever me etched in my mind. It took me many years to understand the true meaning of this word in our National Anthem and I will always remember it. Rest In Peace, your Honour, for we shall be eternally grateful for all that you have done for Singapore, and we shall keep on forging forward! Thank you, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

Wong Soon Hong

Dear Mr Lee,
Your legacy and achievements are for all to see.
You are not only a great statesman, but also a faithful husband, a devoted father and a doting grandfather. What else can we ask from a man like this.


We as Singaporean, are forever grateful to what you have given us and words cannot explain how sad I was when I heard this news. Would love to have you around to celebrate the jubilee year with us but unfortunately, it wasn’t to be.

I was there at SGH last Sunday (22 Mar 2015) to pen my well wishes just before you passes on. I remembered that there was a heavy downpour of rain throughout the whole island and today, during the final send off, it happened again. Maybe it was a coincidence or maybe it was not.

Nevertheless, you have devoted your whole life to build a solid foundation for our future generation and I am sure that the only way to go for Singapore is up.

The citizens have spoken, Mr Lee.
Rest in peace.
Majulah Singapura
Yah Dihao & Family

Dear Sir,

I was planning to drop by Parliament House to pay my last respects or join my parents at the CC yesterday to pen my message, but decided not to as I know I’ll be standing at one of the tables, thinking hard on what i should write. Even as i type this message now, I’m not sure how i am going to start as there are many thoughts running through my head – so here goes.

Growing up, I resented the education policies you made – such as Bilingualism. I hated attending language classes at school, for the teachers taught the language by asking us to memorise the words for 听写，造句. While others excelled at memorising, I was bad at it – I only understood the beauty of my mother tongue and English after I left Secondary School, where I learnt the language slowly at my own pace and by understanding the meaning behind the words used. My creative side was not an advantage during my childhood and teenage years, as it was a stable route to go into business, sciences than the arts in Singapore. As my grandpa would put it, artists only become profitable after they passed away. While majority benefited from the Singapore Education System and Meritocracy, I had a bumpy ride with it.

It’s been years since then, I am now a developer at a small local enterprise – where I can tap into my creative side when providing solutions for my clients. I don’t hate you for what you have done as it must have been hard having to decide the livelihood of the entire nation. Thank you for the contributions and sacrifices you made for Singapore, along with the old guards.

Say hello to my grandpa over at the other side, he’s a fan of yours. : )

We are all shocked and saddened by the departure of our great founding father, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. He was a fantastic man, he gave his life unconditionally to the people of Singapore, and to the world. It is a terrible lost to us, as a nation up shaped by him and his comrades.


Despite his heavy criticisms from his opponents, Mr Lee was a successful firm man of his words. Not many were like him – what he dare to say, he dare to act. He was a man of his words. That what brings him about to be the best blessings to us as a small nation of Singapore. We owe him much that we all live in such comfortable homes and lives. He has brought Singapore from third world to first, where we were respected by the world.

Not only is he a fellow country man of all times, but we do see him as a worthy good example, of a family man. He has his soft side which touches the heart of many.

Mr Lee, Thank you for giving so much to our nation, and your endless selfless giving. We, the citizens of Singapore, and the people of thr world will miss you very much.

May you rest in peace.
Lim Teck Han

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


Our nation will forever be in your debt for your great vision-to turn a fishing village into a metropolis, perserverance-against all odds and opposition, courage-in tumultous times, unparalled love-the greatest any man can have for their country and passion-relentless desire for Singapore to succeed.
All the sacrifices you made and the dedication of your entire adult life so that we may all have a roof over our heads, food in our stomachs, education and employment to ensure our continued survival and to be able to have and do all with peace of mind is the legacy you have left. Exactly as your son, our Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said,””There will NOT be another Mr Lee Kuan Yew””. I cannot agree more.

I believe all of Singapore and Singaporeans share my sentiments and join me in honouring you with greatest respect. Thank you Mr Lee for having gone beyond your duty and leaving us with a country we are so proud to be a part of.

May you rest in peace and be forever united with your beloved wife.

With deepest gratitude and respect,
Fiona KE E-Ling

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


Thank you for the years of relentless striving to better the life of all Singaporeans. You stood tall on the world stage and made your fellow citizens proud, that there is someone from our midst willing to take on the world for our sake. Your clear unwavering positions including that of clean government and meritocracy enabled everyone including someone like me to advance in life in a way that would not have been possible otherwise.

The nation mourns your loss and you will be sorely missed. Going forward we can only build upon your legacy as one people, one nation, one Singapore.
Rachel Lim

I had never given much thought to the history of Singapore for the past years that I have lived. I thought, “”Singapore’s history does not have much to say. After all, we only have 49 years of history to speak about. That definitely isn’t much as compared to the other countries around the world.”” Unfortunately, only after the passing of the respected Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, has realisation hit me like a 200 pound sledgehammer. Singapore’s history, although short, was one extremely well crafted by the late Mr Lee.
Sure, I definitely knew that many people respected the late Mr Lee but I never knew to what extent and for what reasons. For that, I am extremely ashamed of myself to not have bothered about my own country’s state affairs. Whatever had happened or whatever will happen, didn’t matter to me at all. For me, all I wanted was to study hard then think of a possible immigration to other countries in the future. Or rather, my future. Singapore, was simply a ‘stepping stone’ towards one of my future aspirations. Complaining about the many aspects of Singapore was, like many other Singaporeans, “my favourite hobby”. But recently, the sorrow from all around the world, the 24-hour long queues of people standing outdoors waiting for as long as 8 hours to pay tribute to him, great testimonials from many and how he lived his life, etc. Screamed only one thing. Mr Lee Kuan Yew has touched the hearts of many.
Since the passing of noble Mr Lee on the 23rd of March 2015, people from all around the world have been mourning for him and articles on his noble contributions were being passed around and were everywhere. Important political figures worldwide remembers him as a good friend and a role model. The media and all the commemoration was how I got to know more on about his great doings when he lived.
The charismatic Mr Lee, had lived a long life and had worked his hardest for us every single day since the age of 41. He was diligent and focused in his responsibilities towards Singapore, and everything he did every single day were contributions towards Singapore, whether big or small. He had a vision for Singapore and with courage, he stepped out and shouldered the heavy responsibility, which many viewed as a burden while he did not, of bringing Singapore from a land with nothing to a land that prospers. He had attributed the whole of his life to the building of Singapore from nothing to something. He has given us a home, and a national identity that is extremely worthy to be proud of. He had led us to where we are now. If only we knew about the details on what he done earlier and if only his doings were spoken about widely and shared earlier. It would be less of a heartache for many like me. However so, I fully respect the humility of the late Mr Lee when he lived.
This year Singapore celebrates its jubilee year, commemorating the almost-a-miracle building of the Singapore nation. In the celebration of our past 50 years of achievements, we will again, remember our main catalyst Mr. Lee who drove us hard to where we are today, achieving so much in such a short time. After which, our people with the gratitude etched on our minds and the legacy that lives in our hearts, will work harder than ever, sprinting towards the goal that Mr. Lee has set for the future of Singapore in many years to come. We as the citizens of Singapore, will pledge ourselves to build on the foundations of our pioneer generation, to work as one united people, to build a democratic, justified and equated society to achieve happiness, further prosperity and continual progress for our very own nation in which we call home. 50 years does not simply mark our end.
Thank you Mr Lee Kuan Yew for all that you have done. Thank you for aspiring the Singapore now, then. And finally, thank you, for allowing me to be part of the creation that you and your people have worked so hard for.
I believe, our generation will now feel more than honoured to serve the Singapore Nation. Your teachings will be greatly remembered and may you rest in peace now that you have ascended to heaven, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
Vinnie Lim

On remembering..


It was a cosy time hearing stories from aunties and uncles about vicious gang fights, race riots and curfews in 1970s Singapore. When it was our turn, we glanced at each other. We are one of the youngest in the group and had not experienced how Singapore was pre-independence. But the late MM Lee’s influence on us as civil servants is indelible.

The husband shared that when he went on official overseas trips, he had come across foreigners who ask him “”what made you join the public service?”” They were genuinely puzzled that one would prefer the public sector over the private. As the conversation wore on, he realised that for some countries, government officials were highly distrusted. They also shared that in their country, the path was chosen primarily for monetary gains. I am thankful that the late MM Lee had built a system of governance with intolerance for corruption. Today, monetary reasons as the main motivation for entering the civil service is not common.

The past 5 days of reflection on the late MM’s actions and dedication to the country struck a chord in me. Since stepping into public service, MM’s style has somehow been imbued in my work ethos. The spirit of excellence, the need to think through all angles, the imperative to account to tax-payers, the discipline to write simply and clearly, are some examples of the late MM’s influence permeating through the voices of bosses over the years. This morning I had a laugh when I read the newspapers. A lady had written about how MM inspected the toilet before an opening ceremony. It resonated with me. In the few events I had to organise, I was also taught to make sure that the toilets were clean and had sufficient toilet rolls. In reading the many stories about MM, I have come to understand that similar good practices ingrained in the civil service are mostly attributable to him.

There is much more to be thankful for and we pray that the future generations to come will not forget what MM’s legacy has taught us.
Min Ching

I was born here in 1964. I grew up in those difficult times when you, and your team, struggled to build our nation.
Today, my life is comfortable. I had a decent education, have a decent job and managed to build a home here. These were achieved, no doubt, in some ways through my own efforts.
But it was only possible because of the foundations that you, and your team, had laid down for us.
For it was your leadership and your team’s effort that have transformed this little Red Dot to what Singapore is today.
For that, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, sir, I am thankful and grateful. I am living comfortably on the legacy that you have left us.
Thank you.
And to me, sir, you have never left us. You have left us your wisdom, love, passion, beliefs and so much more which can be seen & felt every where on this little Red Dot.
To me, you are Singapore.


Yours faithfully,
S. Hoon

In yesterday’s Special Parliamentary Sitting to pay tribute to the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Minister Ng Eng Hen recounted this of Mr Lee: In 1968, an MP asked in Parliament, how the British withdrawal would impact Singapore. Mr Lee told Singaporeans plainly that the British bases made up 20 per cent of the GNP and tens of thousands of jobs would be lost. To overcome this drastic impact, Singaporeans would have “to adapt and adjust, without any whimpering or wringing of hands, as a way of life which they have been accustomed to over 30 years comes to an end”. When another MP followed and asked if economic aid from the British could ease the effects of the pull-out, Mr Lee’s quick and unequivocal rejoinder was that any aid should “”not make us dependent on perpetual injections of aid from the outside””, that “”…we cannot change our attitude to life, that the world does not owe us a living and that we cannot live by the begging bowl. The best way of meeting the problem is to go about it quietly and intelligently discussing our problems in a low key and with as little fuss and bother as possible.””


It is clear that Singapore would not have come this far without Mr Lee’s brilliant and decisive leadership. Mr Lee was a tough man, and he brought the country through tough times. As a child of the 80’s, I have grown up in relative peace and prosperity as compared to those before my time. The Singapore River was already clean and flanked by gleaming skyscrapers, and Singapore, with its gushing Merlion, had made it as a First World country that many in the region were envious (and some might say, jealous) of. In school, we were constantly reminded that we should not rest on the laurels of those before us, and that we should continue to work hard to progress our nation. Singapore has come this far by being stoic and pragmatic and industrious, and we should not lose these values.

We are still today, a young nation and even as we remember the achievements that have been accomplished by those before us, more importantly we should remember that hardships can come in different forms. It is wise that we do not become complacent nor divisive, and continue to stand united as a one people to weather through thick and thin. Mr Lee shall remain always a great inspiration for my generation and generations to come.
Lee Hui Ying, SLNG

We Singaporeans are blessed to have had such a great leader. We will not be where we are today without him. He fought for us and spent his life building a successful Singapore. Everything he did and every decision he made, was for the good of Singapore and its people. He left behind a huge legacy, and we will continue to build on what he left for us. Thank you so much Mr Lee Kuan Yew!!
Ang Pei Pei, SLNG

A day that will undoubtedly leave an inedible mark on our lives. I was deeply saddened and no words could utter the feeling of waking up with the news for the passing of a great leader, the founding Father of Singapore – Mr Lee Kuan Yew. I believe people all around the world are as well grieving over the loss of a remarkable, brilliant leader. My heartfelt condolences to the family and citizens of Singapore.


This week marks a sombre and reflective week for Singapore and many others. I wasn’t part of the generation who lived through the historical transition; neither am I a Singaporean, nor I know Mr Lee in person; I don’t know much about him and the history but the feeling of dolefulness however is overwhelming, that, even photos and news feeds on social medias could make me tear. Words can’t adequately express how I feel and the gratitude for what you have done for your nation.

My heart has been deeply saddened by your loss and touched by your hard works and passion and building a nation. Through the countless articles, speeches, eulogies that I have came across over the week shown me that you are indeed a great leader, a great father of nation, a great husband and as well a great man.

Mr Lee, you were a man with word, never an empty promise. Your love for the nation and the family touches me deep down. My million thank and gratitude isn’t enough for the tangible evidence of your hard work that has benefited me directly and for the values that you have held throughout your life. Without you, Mr Lee, I wouldn’t be stepping on a city with great education and people. Without you, I wouldn’t be fulfilling my dream and aspiration over at the city you have built. I want to say thank you for being supportive of foreign students studying over here; our safety, opportunities, comfortable life and many many more.

The heavens cry as the nation mourns. Here comes the point where we have to bid goodbye. Without you, Singapore would not be where she is today. You have lived through to see your hard work to fruition and your legacy will continue. You will be greatly missed but will forever live in our hearts. Thank you Mr Lee, may you rest in peace.
Jasmine Goh

They say history is made by great men and I truly believe so. Mr Lee rose amongst common men during the early tumultuous years of Singapore’s independence and shouldered a nation’s hopes and dreams. He led the nation to her success through his wisdom, foresight, grit and a deep conviction to better the lives of fellow Singaporeans. Today, we mourn the passing of a great man. But, we seek comfort that his name shall forever be engraved in the history of Singapore. His vision shall be propagated by every Singaporean. Thank you Sir, for everything you have done for us all.
Lim Bing Yao, SLNG

It was your vision and leadership that led to the success which Singapore enjoys today. You have left Words will not suffice to express our gratitude. Even as we grieve, the outpouring of heartfelt community spirit in the Padang queue, as one united people, stands testament to your life’s achievements. We are indeed blessed to have had you as the founding Prime Minister. I salute you Sir, for your unwavering love for your wife and selfless passion for Singapore. Thank you Mr Lee.
Jan Woon, SLNG

Tribute to our founding father Mr Lee Kuan Yew


1923-2015

You are indeed profoundly intelligent, compellingly articulate and obsessively passionate legacy world class leader as they said.

You fought hard to lead Singapore out of a turbulent and uncertain era and shaped her into a first world country.

We can never find another great man like you. You have dedicated your entire life with selfless sacrifice and protected our country with all your heart & soul. Your tremendous contributions and perseverance has made this little red dot roar like a lion and made significant influence to the world.

I pray that our nation will continue to build on the invaluable foundation that you have laid for us and make Singapore a better place where we call home. Without you, we wouldn’t be enjoying a safe, clean, green and efficient first world garden city.

THANK YOU for not giving up on us! You will always remain in our hearts. You have made us proud. I am proud to call myself a Singaporean!

I salute you with highest honour & respect

Your fellow Singaporean.
Ivy

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


You have inspired a nation. You have given us hope. You have taught us important virtues such as hard work, determination, honesty, integrity and respect. Most of all, you have built Singapore to be a place where all Singaporeans have the opportunities to excel and maximise their fullest potential, regardless of our social economic background. For all that you have done for Singapore, we THANK YOU.
John Ng, CEO of Singapore LNG Corporation

“ A public figure, yet a very private man.


We all think we knew Mr Lee, having listened to him speak, scold, demand, guide, stare and point but few have known him for who he really is. Mr Lee was only doing his job. I have disagreed and even been angry with him for being so ‘strict’. Again Mr Lee was only doing his job. Mr Lee took his job very seriously and, one he had dedicated his whole life to.

Today we all get to know Mr Lee for who he really is. Mr Lee cared. Mr Lee cared about everyone and everything. That is how Singapore came about, because everyone and everything mattered.

A man with a golden heart and an intelligent mind. Singapore is so lucky to have Mr Lee guide us through the tough times and laid the foundation for generations to come.

I am 39 this year and growing up, Mr Lee is invincible. Mr Lee was unbeatable. Never wavered and never gave in. Few have such a strong mind. Mr Lee took punches from the very people he cared for and work so hard to provide for. But Mr Lee stayed firm in his belief and for that, we are now the Singapore that we are.

Deeply saddened, eternally grateful. We have no fear knowing this day has come and you are no longer physically with us for you have thought us to be strong individuals, with integrity and confidence, we are ready to take on new challenges the world will continue to face.

Deepest condolences to your family, especially to Mr Lee Hsien Long, who despite his grief, has to carry out his duties as a Prime Minister. Just like you would have done so.

Rest now and be assured that Singapore will sail forth with pride and confidence.

Thank you, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

A proud Singaporean, Grace ..

Dear Mr Lee,

Your profound wisdom, teachings, and governing efficiency have made our little “”red dot”” country elevated to significant world stage. We thank you most profoundly.

I have travelled to many places in the world and the minute I identified myself as a Singaporean, the next comments I received was “”Your country very clean, beautiful, very efficient and you have a great stable Government under Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew””. Everybody knew about Singapore through Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s effective leadership and he was looked upon as a great communicator who had delivered his talks which today were transparent in the Legacy he had left behind to everybody.

Mr Lee Kuan Yew connected Singapore’s businesses with the world and have never waivered from his visionary goal to aim for national economic achievement. Thank you once again.

To list the achievements of Mr Lee Kuan Yew are as boundless as the “”stars in the sky””.

Inspiration from books and past speeches of Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s eternal fountain of wisdom will be the greatest motivation for all to emulate.

Thank you Mr Lee Kuan Yew for your Legacy to Singaporeans and we will miss YOU, the most impressive, intellectual and practical leader of this century.

Rest in Peace and I am confident Singapore’s leaders will carry on your marathon torch and will lead Singapore to a very bright future.

Sending sincere condolences to Mr Lee Hsien Loong & family at this sad time.

Yours sincerely,
Rita Ng Lai Ling

To Mr Lee Kwan Yew – with the inevitable finally coming to pass, I thank you for being such an inspiration over the years I have lived in Singapore.


When I first came to live here, and discovered your profound words and actions that wrote the course of history over five decades, my subsequent years on this island would become a time to really sit up and continually contemplate life’s important questions, and thanks to you, this period undoubtedly helped shape my world view.

More recently, my family discovered that my long lost grandfather served in Singapore during WW2 and was made POW somewhere near Holland Village in 1942. This was something many families had to endure, and indeed hugely significant to you Mr Lee, who was also captured during that time.

With such massive struggle over the years, your boundless passion for life, such dedication to your wife, and an unmistakable frankness to saying what you felt needed to be said remains your inspiring trademark attribute.

Although I never met Mr Lee, I had the privilege of working on one of his tribute films and so hope my very small contribution to honouring his life will play a part in remembering one of the world’s most remarkable human beings.

Rest in peace Mr Lee Kwan Yew – 1923 to 2015
Emile Guertin

At a young age, I believe that Mr Lee has fought for the nation, succeeding in growing Singapore as what it is today. His people, respect him, look up to him and support his decision. I may not have witness major contributions done by him but I always believe that his actions were right and best for Singapore.
His values became meaningful to me – to be a good listener and aim for higher level of education. Thanks to him, we have a higher quality of life and better living environment.
On behalf of my grandmother, who has been a big fan of Mr Lee Kwan Yew, I pray for him to rest in peace and proceed to the next stage of life.
Thank you Mr Lee. Thank you for your greatest effort for Singapore. Thank you for motivating and having faith in your people. May you rest in peace and we will all remember you, your kindness and your rights. The light and brightness of Singapore, as what is represented in your name.

Dear Mr. Lee,


Thank you for all your hard work building this nation. I never knew the amount of dedication you put in and the hardships you went through until I saw the tributes and documentaries after your passing.

From the number of people who turned up to pay their respects to the foreign VIPs who flew in, there’s no doubt you have touched their lives in one way or another. May present and future generation continue to honor you and build on the foundation that you and your team have laid.

Once again thank you and may God continue to bless your family.

Dear Mr Lee


Thank you for all that you have done for Singapore. You have developed Singapore, putting in so much hard work for the nation. You helped us create reservoirs so that we have sufficient water every day. You provided us with good and proper education.
You did not give up on Singapore despite challenges, instead you continued to figure out better ways to develop Singapore. Thank you for having the perseverance. You made sure Singapore did not have riots and also built HDB flats for us to live in because you were worried about our safety. You maintained the clean policy of Singapore, by taking the initiative to sweep the floors.
Words cannot describe my gratitude for what you have done for us.

Tribute to Mr Lee Kuan Yew


When I was a boy, I was suddenly ushered out of the cinema midway through a movie. Outside, I saw police waving batons moving the people away to go home. Curfew followed shortly due to a racial riot between Malays and Chinese.

I experienced two occasions of massive flooding in the ‘60s. I was living on the ground floor of a shop house. People waded in dirty floodwaters above their knees.

These are images of Singapore in the past. We no longer have to struggle through such unpleasant times. Thanks to the strong, dedicated and visionary leadership of Mr Lee Kuan Yew and the efforts of his team. In a short period of just 50 years, Singapore has been transformed. We enjoy racial harmony; we have active, beautiful and clean waterways, and greenery around our ever dense but pleasant built-up and buzzing urban landscape.

I am deeply saddened at the death of our founding father, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Mr Lee has left behind a large legacy for us. He has dedicated his life to make Singapore what it is today. In fact, watching and reading the tributes and condolence messages penned by world leaders, my heart is overwhelmed with pride that his influence and contributions have gone far beyond the shores of Singapore, the little red dot. I am proud that he is more than equal among the great leaders of the modern world. His worldview and the philosophy that he embraced and shared have benefited many world leaders and their countries too.

I have fond memory of my only encounter with Mr Lee, then Prime Minister. I met him in person when I was a young architect in PWD working on the refurbishment of the City Hall building in 1988. He dropped in unannounced to look at the project. He came alone (no big party accompanying) and I was alone too as my senior architect could not arrive in time. I showed him around some of the work in progress. He surprised me with his great attention to details, asking questions about the building materials used, their origin and costs.

His passing is a great loss to Singapore, but we have much to gain from him. He has made us proud to be Singaporeans. We have a beautiful and safe place to call home. I am grateful for his selfless dedication for Singapore. Most grateful is that he instituted a system of peaceful and smooth succession of political leadership. It can ensure that what he tirelessly built will last. It gives us a strong resolve to continue his values and aspirations for an even better Singapore.

Thank you most deeply, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

Dear PM Lee Hsien Loong,
My deepest condolences to you and your family. My prayers are with you and your family members. I thank God for giving us such an honourable man of great intellect and astute leadership, and yet humble and personable, at a time when Singapore needed most. May God grant you peace and comfort during this time of bereavement and continue to bless you and your team with strength and wisdom as you lead Singapore beyond SG50.

Dear Mr Lee,
I have read all your books and was always intrigued by your work for Singapore, but never in my 38 years have I felt this way as I do now having to immerse myself into your world with the flood of TV recordings, speeches and photographs. What struck me was a devotion and discipline to family and nation that provides the deep foundation that drives you. I have been privileged in my career to have met and worked with some esteemed men this world has seen. I have been inspired by some of them no less share some of the traits I see in you as well.


This week, you have provided me a valuable lesson in life. This week, I have begun to cherish my family and nation in a very different but assuring way. This week, I have through your passing become inspired to not just think about our country but what I can do for it. The noise and sound this week are but noise and whilst I know many of us appreciate and are grateful to you, I hope that this does change the complacency I see and allow us not to forget the true cause of your work.

You have loved this country so much because we call this home. We face no suppression today, only our own, in such shallow thoughts when I want an equally good opportunity for my children. And I care too much as you did for your fellow citizens.

Sir, thank you for what you have done. You have laid the foundation and conditions for many of us to continue the flame of hardworking, diligent, thoughtful and passionate spirit and I hope I will be able to do my small part in making you equally proud of us all.

Gratefully and respectfully, Adrian

Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


Thank you for all that you have done for Singapore. We would not be where we are today without your leadership, perseverance and foresight. The whole of Singapore as one, mourns for your passing on, but the whole of Singapore as one, also celebrates your life.

At last year’s national day when I saw you for a brief moment on national television, my heart filled with so much thankfulness and respect for you, and I stood up and clapped for you, the one who gave your entire life for this nation of Singapore. You looked like you aged a lot and I remember telling my family that I hoped so much that you would be able to witness Singapore’s 50th birthday this August. When I heard news that you passed away, my heart was very saddened. This year’s national day (and the rest to come) wouldn’t ever be the same again without your presence.

I feel also very sad that I am overseas now and unable to physically be with my fellow Singaporeans in Singapore during this significant time in the history of Singapore. I wish I was now in Singapore, watching Singapore news and flipping through the newspapers reading stories about your life, and paying my last respects to you. Being away from Singapore at this time makes me realise how much Singapore means to me, as my home and my country, and how much I respect you for all that you have done. My friends and family back home have been sending me short clips of the state funeral and pictures of newspaper articles of how Singapore is remembering you during this time. As I looked through the videos and newspapers, I am heartened to see how Singaporeans have put aside all their differences and have united as one to mourn for your passing.

I’m penning this e-tribute for you, from the land of Nepal, to say thank you. I would not be where I am today if not for your love and dedication to our nation.

You will always be remembered, by me, by Singapore, by the world.
Sherlyn Ang

Dear Mr Lee,


I would like to thank you for all that you have done for us, Singaporean. Your big vision, wisdom, determination and perseverance bring good life to Singaporean. It is fortunate to be born in this safe, clean and comfortable Singapore and I am always so proud to be a Singaporean. Without you, all these wouldn’t have been possible.

I will remember your fighting spirit, treasure the legacy you left us and play my part as a Singapore citizen to build upon this legacy to make Singapore even a better home in many generations to come.

You will be dearly missed and remembered in our heart always. You worked very hard your entire life for us, Singaporean, for a better life, please rest well now and may you rest in peace.

Thanks again.

This is from one of my favorite authors: “Everyone must leave something behind when he dies, my grandfather said. A child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes made. Or a garden planted. Something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die, and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted, you’re there.


It doesn’t matter what you do, he said, so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something that’s like you after you take your hands away. The difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching, he said. The lawn-cutter might just as well not have been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime.”
― Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451

You’re the gardener, sir. May your legacy live on forever.

Juria Toramae

Dear Mr Lee,


In your passing, I give thanks to you and your team for laying the foundation of this republic. I like to highlight areas deserving praise.

In education, many have been uplifted out of poverty. Education is key to the thinking man. Without the capacity to read and learn, a man is doomed to ignorance. The key to controlling a population is depriving them of education, but you have done the opposite. You have given the populace the key to free themselves, opening up for many to have good jobs and exploring the world. The critics of today is also a product of this education. Without education, many would never even learn to question.

In housing, the modest HDB flat is testimony of good public housing. Many have benefited from a roof over the head, electricity, sanitation and clean water. Many of us take these comforts for granted, failing to acknowledge that these are the results of good governance.

No critic can take away the fact that Singapore is what it is today because of you and your team. You have made Singapore bigger than what it seems.

Thank you, Mr Lee, and may the republic lives on.

Lor

“ Dear Sir,


We are really thankful to you for what you have done for this country. We are enjoying the fruits of your hard work. Your life will always remain inspiration for generations to come.
We will progress and preserve what you have given to us.

Thanks from bottom of our heart. Rest in peace. You will always remain in our hearts.
Medha

Dearest Mr Lee,


Thank you for the numerous contributions and decisions which made Singapore leaped from a 3rd world country to a 1st world country. During this week of mourning, TV has been showing the past Mr Lee Kuan Yew success, it was good for the young generations as they were not born at the time when Singapore has fought for it’s independence. It was then also made known to me that Mr Lee’s contribution and his vision foresight were very accurate and was at all best interest for Singapore. Without fighting independence (Merdeka) in 1965, Singapore will not be a country of itself.
Now, Singapore is no longer a small dot, it is a country full of hopes and I am proud to call it home. This 50 years of transformation made Singapore bloom into a 1st world country where it is clean and green.
No words can express my gratitude, respect, appreciation for you, Mr Lee. Without you, there will never be a Singapore like today.
Thank you Mr Lee for everything.

Prayers to PM Lee and his family,
May Mr Lee Kuan Yew rest in peace.
Alvin

Singapore is my home and forever will be. I’m proud to be called Singaporean. I served my country with all my pride and give my all to this country. Why? Cause of you Sir.


You have made Singapore your life and you made Singapore what it is today. Without your hard work, vision and undying love to unite the people of Singapore, it will be a very different Singapore. As the pledge goes, regardless of race, language or religion, no country comes close to Singapore in terms of living harmoniously and cohesively despite our differences. People can wander in the street late at night and not worrying about their safety. And among your endless and unspoken contributions to Singapore, i truly am grateful for the safe, peaceful, corruption free, well maintained, beautiful garden city that i call Home. No matter how long i am posted overseas for work, i still miss Singapore. Thank you Mr Lee Kuan Yew for everything.

May you Rest in Peace knowing that you have done everything that you could for us.
Lots of Love, Airil, Shereen & Audrina Seet

Dear Mr Lee,


I can never thank you enough for giving us a wonderful Home.. A place that is safe and loving … A place where we are given the opportunity to be educated, to learn and to be ourselves.,, Most importantly, a place to call our own..

Without your unwavering and unconditional efforts and contributions, this wouldn’t be possible.., I’m really ever grateful from deep inside me for all the things you have done for us. Instead of enjoying the fruits of your labour with us, you left us ….there’s no Home without you. You are the Father of this Home you have built. Like any Father, you are always here to protect and shield us from any harm and danger…

It’s sad to say goodbye…your presence will be dearly missed.. You’ll always stay in our hearts and memories… May you rest in peace, Founding Father.,,,

您辛苦了，一路走好，安息吧！
永远怀念您！
With respect, Fong 28 March 2015

Dear Sir,


I was overwhelmed with emotions and unspeakable gratitude towards you, as I walked with thousands of grieving citizens to pay our final respects. I was born in during the period of time when the Mass Rapid Transit project was built, according to my mother. Even though I was not in the era when there was social turbulence, unrest and the implementation of contentious policies, and how things slowly settled down, I was able to witness how the town I am living in, slowly rose into a busy urban site from bare empty grass lands.

Sir, you have spent the entire life, crafting this powerful nation, and upon your passing, brought all Singaporeans closer together. A visionary statesman you are, with powerful instinct, foresight, impeccable ideals and planning, intelligence and wisdom, leading Singapore to the state she is now, and your sacrifices enabled all of us to enjoy the fruits of your labour.

Countless of “”Thank you”” will never be enough to express our gratitude towards what you have done. May Singapore continue to strive, together with us, Singaporeans. Have a rest well deserved, Sir. Rest in peace. We will continue to do you proud.
Aerieath Seng

I am truly blessed and proud to be a Singaporean.
As a youth, I’d only appreciated being a Singaporean as much as my cognition takes me. My pride as a Singaporean was derived from the text in Civics Education. My pride was cognitive.


As a working adult and having worked overseas, appreciation and pride grew from cognition to affection. The appreciation of what I used to take for granted, the law and order, the stability, the development and foresight of our leaders. The praises my foreign friends and associates sing of Singapore elevated my pride. My pride was affective.

As a Singaporean, this week, with the passing of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the term ‘Singaporean’ took on a different meaning. What we are known for : disciplined, hardworking, uncorrupt, etc, were not incidental. These traits were the results of well-planned and thoroughly thought through policies.

This week, Singaporeans showed togetherness, appreciation, gratitude, respect, civic-mindedness.
My pride as a Singaporean was emotive.

As an educator, I will strive impart values to nurture good and useful citizens, to inculate the national identity, to carry on the legacy and to continue to make Singapore a better home. My purpose is clear.

And now, my pride as a Singaporean is instinctive.
I stand with my head held high, I AM SINGAPOREAN.

Thank you, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
Christina Chang KH

Dear Mr Lee,


Thank you for everything you have done for Singapore. You have spent almost your whole life, with unwavering dedication and hard work to build up Singapore to what she is today. Singapore is very fortunate to have you as our 1st PM during the early years.

As more stories of you start to emerge on news & social media, you have gained many more Singaporeans’ respect & admiration, especially from the younger generation who are very fortunate to enjoy the fruits of your labour. We also start to learn more about you, about your frugality & your love for your family & your people. You are even admired & respected overseas.

Mr Lee, you are a good role model for us to follow. You will always be fondly remembered in every Singaporeans’ heart & in future generations to come as a great founding father.
With love & gratitude, Charlotte Neo

Dear Mr Lee,


Thank you for very much for your contribution to building Singapore from a small fishing village into a first world country. Without you, we are not even a dot, but because of your great contribution, we are now a small red dot which shines like a red ruby among a cup of pure crystal.

I live in the time when you are the PM of Singapore. I watch most telecast of your speech. I look forward to your speech each time they were delivered. Although I might not fully understand, I enjoy watching you over TV.

Our day starts with a fresh gush of tap water, which is so clean and conveniently available from home tap. We stay in a safe and secure flat. We open the windows and we see a garden of green, we breathe fresher air.

When it’s time for children to school, public buses are easily available across the overhead bridge. We do not need to walk in mud like those days in kampung.

The children are bilingualists, although I hope they could pick up dialect as well. At this point, they speak English and Mandarin, At least they could interact with the world, for now and in the future.

Without the stability of the country, investors are not going to come in. I previous have a job with a foreign company and at least I have a stable income. I am currently a homemaker as I think that educating children and taking care of them, bring them up well, is as important too.

Thank you very much for all these, I am deeply grateful.

You left. I wet my eyes almost everyday. We no longer can see you LIVE on TV. We lost our precious Great man. No word can express the pain deep in me for losing you, our Singapore Father, Mr Lee KY.

Please take a higher rebirth, Mr Lee.

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


Thank you so much for building this home for us known as Singapore. Without your limitless love, effort and even spending your whole life building it, we won’t be able to live and stay peacefully in such prosperous country and built our lovely home. No matter where I go or where I am, it always made me proud being born and raised as a Singaporean.

Thank you always, as you took great care to all of us liked your children and paved road for us to walk on comfortably. There were too many things to thank you about and too many things that you had delivered to us making what we are today.

We will always remember you in our hearts and love this Singapore which you had spent your whole life building for us. Rest in peace, Mr Lee.
With love and gratitude, Ray Wong & family, 28 March’15

No words can describe and no actions can express my gratitude towards you. Thank you for being a respectable and loving father to all of us Singaporeans. You have contributed a lot and dedicate your life in building Singapore from a mudflat to a metropolis. Your struggles and relentless efforts is what made us who we are today. Your willingness and unconditional love for Singapore has made us one of the most successful countries, transforming us to a first-world country from a third-world country.


Your vision and foresight transformed Singapore to a global metropolis , therefore I feel blessed to be a Singaporean, blessed to be a part of a country full of prosperity, peace and harmony. This is why I’m always proud to call Singapore my home, a place of comfort and joy. No other place in the world can make me feel safer.

Your courage and strong determination always inspires me. There was always an answer to a solution when it comes to you. No matter how daunting the task is, it never seem impossible due to your persistence and hard will. You may be gone however, your memories and laurels lives on. And Singapore is a living proof. You are a fair, righteous, selfless leader, an examplary model for many world leaders.

You will be dearly missed not only by me and my fellow Singaporeans but also by everyone around the world who recognizes you as a visionary and great leader. Your legacy will live on for generations to come.

It is 4.30am Thursday 26 March 2015 as I am penning this down. This is my personal tribute to Mr. Lee Kuan Yew who passed away peacefully on March 23 2015. I have always told my wife, why does anyone pen down a tribute – who reads it anyway! But here I am writing this, with the hope that in another 50 years time, if I am lucky, I get to re-read this note on how I am feeling during this period of national mourning.


Together with my wife and sister-in-laws, we have just paid our respects to Mr. Lee in Parliament House. The mood as we entered the hall was somber. I was nervous, as I didn’t know what sort of emotions would come over me. A big picture of his was in-front of the casket. I moved along the line, stopped and bowed three times. I was straining my neck to try to catch a glimpse of him at peace. I was half hoping that he would get up and start scolding us – “Why are you wasting time queuing? You don’t have to work tomorrow??!!!” My imagination was punctured by a quiet but fast sobbing of an elderly woman who had to be consoled by her daughter. Despite the men in green trying to move the line out as quickly as possible, I slowed down my pace and tried to linger as long as I could near the casket. This was my only and last chance to be close to a great leader and gladiator of Singapore.

I was probably too young to see or understand the changes that Mr. Lee made to Singapore from the late 1950s. I never lived through the Japanese occupation, the uncertain times when the British pulled out of Singapore, the threat of the communist insurgents or the racial and student riots. I don’t know what it is like to live in slumps or the joy of moving to high-rise flats from these slumps. I have never experienced water rationing or the uncertainty of mass unemployment. Hence I must admit, my feeling of sadness is not at the same level as that of my Father and our Pioneer Generation when the news of Mr. Lee’s passing broke on the wee hours of Monday morning. However, I greatly admire and respect Mr. Lee for his values, passion, single-mindedness, intellect and resolve. As with most Singaporeans, I am grateful to Mr. Lee for dedicating his life to Singapore, without which I am not sure we can enjoy the kind of life that we have right now.
Mr. Lee’s values of hard work, integrity, perseverance, and resilience are even more relevant now in this increasingly uncertain world. Many may not have agreed with his knuckle buster and tough love approach to nation building, but it is something befitting of for that period of time. How Mr. Lee came out of his moment of anguish with greater resolve and then went on to achieve greater things is something I am learning with my own moments of anguish. Mr. Lee’s oratory skills is second to none. His speeches were robust and fiery. I remembered watching all of Mr. Lee’s speeches on the internet whilst preparing for a speech examination for a Business Communications module in university. I even tried to learn his habit of pulling his pants up while trying to make a major point!

On our journey back home from Parliament House, we discussed about the future of Singapore after Mr. Lee. My sister in laws felt uncertain at how Singapore will cope should there be a serious crisis. Will our youths have the toughness, guts and gumption to stand up and be counted? Will Singapore have a soul? I don’t think any of us will have the answer. But I think a good start is to make sure that we never forget the Lee Kuan Yew story and that our youths understand what he stands for and what he had had gone through to make Singapore it is today.

May you rest in peace Mr. Lee Kuan Yew.

“Merdeka! One more time with more feeling… Merdeka!”
Melvin Vu

Dearest Mr Lee,
Thank you, although words alone is not enough to express my gratitude to you. I have chosen to stay away from the historic queuing at the Parliament House area, but tostay home to watch the videos of you from early days to the most recent appearance of you, of what you said, what you did and how you transformed mudflats to metropolis.


I never paid so much attention during history lessons in school. This week, Singapore woke up to the fact that the peace and prosperity that we enjoy, have not come by accident. You are the Godsend gift to my country, my home. If not for you, I wouldn’t be blessed with the opportunities at school, at work and raising my children. I am able to speak fluent and write English and Chinese, only because of you.

I wept a lot this week, just like many others in Singapore. I would miss you. For sure, going forward, as I watch our future leaders perform, I will ponder “”what would LKY have done?””

You physically depart tomorrow. We start a new chapter without LKY. But you will watch over us, right?

Rest in peace, Mr Lee.
Agnes Lim

With a heavy heart, the nation bids farewell to an honourable and highly respected leader, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.


Without his vision and strong willpower in building this nation out of nothing, there wouldn’t be Singapore on the map.

前人种树，后人乘凉
Without him and his team, we wouldn’t have a house to live in, potable water straight from the tap, an established and highly efficient transport network compared abroad, a clean and green city. With his strict law and regulation, we don’t have to worry about food safety or crime in our neighbourhood. Not forgetting his bilingualism policy and high quality education system, we have become competent and adept citizens.

Of course, the wise man had done more than the aforementioned.
Mr Lee’s foresight paved the way for the gleaming success of modern Singapore. Indeed, Singapore is our home truly.

Mr Lee will be deeply missed as we won’t see another man like him.

With deepest gratitude and appreciation to our founding father, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
Pamela

Dear Mr. Lky,


Your contribution to this country and its people are indescribable. You took helm of segregated, poor and dirty mess and took it to where it is today. You are passionate, dedicated and your wisdom and foresight remains unparrelled in the region. Your voice and presence commanded the utmost respect and admiration from people worldwide.

Take a look around us and take a moment to think about this. Would things be the same if it wasn’t for you? Would I even be here if it wasn’t for you? I dare say that the train I am riding on as I pen this wouldn’t be here, the HDB I live in wouldn’t be there and the safe society that even most first world country dream of having wouldn’t exist. Singapore wouldn’t exist.

But these are just the tangible things that you have left behind. Looking beyond this, you have left behind something of unfathomable scale. You have created a sense of national identity, a national spirit, a sense of belonging. Singapore Singaporean, that I am proud of.

What is your life story? Your life is the story of how Sigapore came to be what it is. We are eternally grateful for what you have left behind. Your legacy remains.

May you rest in peace.

Prime minister Lee Hsien Loong, I wish to express my deepest and heartfelt condolences to you and your family.
Yours sincerely,Lew Jun Fei

23rd March 2015 was truly a very sad day for all Singaporeans, as our Nation grieved the loss of our founding Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew. Despite that I have never met Mr. Lee in person; he was undoubtedly a legendary great man who I hold in high regard, and his passing deeply pained me.


For many Singaporeans, he was the very man known to have devoted whole of himself, and his life, building Singapore – a place where we are proud to call ‘Our Home’ today. No amount of words can describe my heartfelt gratitude towards him. He was truly a blessing to Singapore.

Thank you Sir, for shining like a candle in the dark, guiding Singapore during her darkest days and bringing her people – hopes. Because of you, each and every Singaporean can dream of a future here. You’re worthy of the honor and love in which you’re held in the hearts of our many Singaporeans today and always. You’re dearly loved and will be remembered. May your soul now rest in peace.

But this is not the end, for your legacy will live on.

The best tribute to Mr. Lee will be we as the Citizens of Singapore, let’s ‘strive on his ideals’ and continue to work hard safeguarding our Nation peace and security, and contribute ourselves to continue help Singapore prospers and flourishes so our next generation after generation could find and ride that rainbow, too.
Joyann Y.

Thank You for your numerous contributions to our beloved homeland Singapore. Without you, Singapore would not be the country we see today. What you have done for us transformed our country from third world to first. You made us proud to be Singaporean, improved our lives and put an emphasis on bilingualism. It was the toughest policy you had made but it was worth it, that is why we can communicate with the world today.


Even though I never met you in my life, I am truly grateful to what you have done for Singapore. You were a man that I respected a lot, a person that I look up to. In the past week, we as a nation stood united and strong, queuing for hours just to see you. This shows what significance you had towards this little tiny red dot. We shall never forget our founding father, and your legacy will leave on for a long time to come, and for the future generation of Singaporeans to know what a fine man you were.

With a heavy heart, I would personally like to thank you Mr Lee, and I hope that you would rest in peace and live a life with no regrets.
Thank You.
谢谢。
Terima Kasih.
நன்றி.

The cortege appeared in sight along New Bridge Road today, and the emotion was palpable in the air. I started tearing, the woman standing next to me started tearing too. As the red and white colours of our flag came closer, the crowd stirred in volume. But we stood calmly behind the blue and white police tape, sharing the space, keeping our umbrellas so that they didn’t block anyone.


My voice strained with emotion, I clutched the flag I had requested off a volunteer from the State Funeral organising committee and waved it at the vehicles passing by. What else could I have said but “”Thank you””? What else could I have said but “”Goodbye””? What was left unspoken was too great to verbalise. Emotion is hard to verbalise, emotion is irrational and unexplained. Amidst the relentless rain, I wiped my face and wasn’t sure if I what I wiped away was rain or tears.

Thank you, Sir. You have left an indelible mark. We are incredibly lucky to have had you. Goodbye.
Cheryl Lim

My family convey deep mourning to your departure. Our condolences are with your family.
Mr. Lee, our sincere appreciation and thanks to you that our family are here today.


Our family and the nation are the witness of your legacy who benefit from your committed, integrated, pragmatic , resilient leadership during extreme global crisis. You have been keeping Singapore shined and onward from one crisis to another.

1997 Catastropic SEA financial crisis, WTC 9-11, SARS, 2009 subprime crisis……..It was your legacy that turned around the nation fast freeing Singapore from severe economy nightmare. In every crisis, you upgraded the nation one step that kept Singapore sustainably competitive in the global economy. The nation was encouraged to improve their cross-border skill through many programs under government schemes. SMEs were getting financial assistance to deal with economy downturn.

You are indeed unmatched visionary statesman. Your spirit and legacy will forever remain with us and the nation setting sustainable standard to the rest of the world.

Please accept our family farewell bid to you Mr. Lee.
You definitely get the highest and most refined place in Him.
Goodbye our beloved hero and founding father of the nation.

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


Sir, Today we mourn yor passing but at the same time we celebrate your life too. How many can truly say they have lived their life well lived? There’s so much gratitude for you, 50 years ago, you believed in us, you lifted us up to where we are now. We are aware that we should not be complacent and we are still have a lot of work to do to keep your legacies alive. Sir, you did not let us down 50 years ago, 50 years and many more years from now, we vow not to let you down. You united a nation then and in your passing, you unite us once again. We are truly One People One Nation One Singapore, regardless of race and religion, we put aside our differences and come together to give you a final bow and say thank you for your all you have done for us!

My only regrets is not being able to let you know how much we appreciated you while you were still with us. You must have heard more complains and grumbling from us than gratidue, for that we are sorry.

Sir, We have not stopped tearing since 23 March and we are sure going to miss you.. We were hoping that you can wait till 9/8 and celebrate SG50 with us, you deserved that! Heart will ache and tears will flow again when we see your empty seat! Your absence will be surely be felt!

Rest now Sir, your wife is waiting to reunite with you. She has selflessly shared you with us and it is only right that we return you to her. Go smell the flowers, listen to the birds sing and stroll with her, just like what you like to do when she was alive. Do not worry about us, we have grown up and will take care of ourselves. You put us on the world map, you made us stand tall and proud, you showed the world where Singapore is. From now on, we shall return this favour by not letting you down and making you proud of us. And lastly, my promise to you is I will vote wisely so that we do not fall into wrong hands and destroy what you have built the last 50 years.

Once again Mr Lee, thank you for all that you have done for us and sorry for not letting you know earlier…

May you reunite with Mrs Lee and God bless both your souls and your family !

With much love from us at home
Magdalene Foo

Thank you for giving us education and equal opportunities and for making Singapore a successful first world nation today.


Your bilingual policy has really benefitted me especially when my family had work assignment in USA in 1985 and China ultimately. Being fluent in both English and Chinese has help me to connect easily with people in other parts of the world.

When I was staying in Suzhou in 2006 , drivers , domestic helpers and common folks I meet are full of admiration and highest respect for Mr Lee Kuan Yew. They told me they are very grateful to Mr Lee as Singapore Suzhou Industrial Project has created job opportunities and improve the livelihood of millions of people there. The reputation of Singapore is definitely very high.

It must be a miracle for Singapore to have a such a great leader and one who has devoted his life to us for 6 decades. Thank you Mr Lee Kuan Yew for everything you have done.

Forever grateful to you
Teck Chor ( a proud Singaporean)

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
You once cried for us now is our turn to cry for you.You spent your life building Singapore and it went to third world to first thanks to your hard work and resilience. If it wasn’t for you we would not be here today.Thank you for everything you have done you were a great leader and an excellent role model.
Sincerely, Carolina Khor Rui Dan 12 years old White sands primary school 6B

Let me express my utmost appreciation, respect and admiration for Mr Lee who has contributed so much to our country and home, Our Singapore.


Elevating Singapore to the world stage with his talents and leadership, our Little Red Dot, Our Singapore, is able to make ourselves heard.

Exemplifying the virtues of a good leader, we look towards the continuation of Mr Lee’s legacy in Singapore.

Key to our transformation from a mudflat to a metropolis, we are eternally grateful to Mr Lee for the leap to the status of a developed economy.

Unwavering and determined in making sure Singapore survives with its newly found independence in 1965, he shows all Singaporeans the power of strong determination and willpower.

An icon of Singapore, we will always remember Mr Lee for his contributions.

Now and forever, history will remember Mr Lee for his foresight, intelligence, charisma and his love for our nation, Singapore.

Young and old, we Singaporeans must continue the good work Mr Lee has started and bring Singapore towards prosperity and a greater profile on the world stage.

Education and Meritocracy, these policies have benefitted many Singaporeans who have achieved social mobility.

We will always remember you, our dearest Mr Lee.

我们会永远怀念您, 建国总理李光耀先生。
DELIA LIM HWEE HWEE

Dear Mr Lee
No amount of words can express the gratitude for the sacrifices you made to make Singapore she is today.


Without your foresight and leadership, my family and I would not have a clean, green and first world Singapore to proudly call home.

Your passing is truly a great loss to us, but your legacy will live on in our hearts forever.

Once again, thank you so very much for giving your life in building up this nation with your life.

Rest in peace, Sir. Serene Tan

Dearest Mr Lee Kuan Yew


On 25th March Time : 0150am -My son and I went to Parliament and pay you our last respect.

I shared my thoughts to my 18 yrs old son ( this May he will be joining the Army) that tonight although is a long queue but WHAT Is 3 hours queuing compared to ‘YOU ‘ MR LEE who has spent and sacrifices yourself for more than ‘5 Decades ‘ with your entire life ‘Protecting ‘ us and this country Singapore from being Harm and your ‘Never Fear ‘ positive leadership just like a responsible father .

When I was reading the newspaper about You Mr Lee and there was 1paragraph recalled about you called your sister and told her you have lost some weight ,you were having the craving of eating ‘Nonya food ‘ .. Sir , my heart goes to you and felt so sad because I know Mrs Lee was no longer there to cook for your favorite food .

I then shared and read this news to my 18yrs old son and told him that -at that moment when Mr Lee told his sister about his craving for Nonya food , it must be hard for him as Mr Lee must be at the same time thinking and missed his dearest wife Mrs Lee dearly.

My Dearest Mr Lee , I want you to know you are always in my prayer and you are :

1. God Sent
2. Special and Unique
3. A Loving father to every Single
Singaporean
4. A Loving husband (as i watched on TV how you lovingly gave Mrs Lee 2kisses ) and a responsible daddy to your dearest family.

Sir, with your ‘SUPERD ‘ Leadership and with all your entire life and the sacrifices you have done for us .. May I dedicate a Special word -‘SING’ to you as how I see it describe about YOU:

SING :
S describe you as -A SINCERE AND SPECIAL MAN
I describe you as – A man that highly practice and believed in ‘ INTEGRITY’
N as in how you have thought us ‘NEVER FEAR’
G describe you as – ‘GOD SENT’ and a ‘GRACIOUS Husband and Father.

Sir, please ‘Rest In Peace ‘ and May you in heaven be united with Mrs Lee ..

We loved you,
Mdm SK YEO, Mstr Son TH

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,

You have inspired a nation. You have given us hope. You have taught us important virtues such as hard work, determination,
honesty, integrity and respect. Most of all, you have built Singapore to be a place where all Singaporeans have the
opportunities to excel and maximise their fullest potential, regardless of our social economic background. For all that you
have done for Singapore, we THANK YOU. – John Ng, CEO

Thank you for your courage, your strength. Thank you for the Singapore today. There will not be another one like you in many
years to come. R.I.P Mr. Lee. – Karyn Tan

I have been following the daily broadcasts about you and your personal and political life. As a proud citizen of Singapore, I
have read and witnessed so many of your remarkable achievements. I have lived and worked in several countries and can
understand and appreciate why you had taken certain tough and unpopular decisions along the way. I believe your vision and
determination to strive for excellence had been of tremendous benefit to all of us in Singapore. What you had done, you did
for the good of Singapore. Over the last few days, you have been described in many ways but what I can relate to from your
speeches and achievements is that you were an extraordinary human being of profound intelligence, one who was
compellingly articulate and obsessively passionate. Thank you for making Singapore what it is. May your soul rest in peace. –
Sandeep Mahawar & Family

We love YEW! Thanks for giving us a Prosperous & Metropolitan Garden City that we can call HOME. We will continue to build
on the legacy that you have left behind. – Kah Chye & Serene

On behalf of my family members, we are really grateful for your dedication in founding and building this country into a
modern, clean and multi-racial society. We will always be grateful for your hard work for Singapore and for the world. Thank
you very much Mr Lee. – Dewi

Without the great leadership of Mr. Lee Kuan Yeow and his team, we will not have the modern Singapore that we have today.
I sincerely appreciate and am thankful for Mr Lee Kuan Yeow and his team’s contributions to nation building all these years. –
Andrea Low

“Life dies, memories remain”… With deepest respect and admiration, I would like to express my thanks to Mr Lee Kuan Yew
for building and sharing this beautiful country. – Alfredo Mariscal Arcila

Thank you for all the things you’ve done to transform Singapore into such a great place to live, work and play. We are very
proud to be Singaporeans, and very proud and grateful to have you as our founding father – one who had always done things
with Singapore’s interests at heart. We also admire your continuous learning and continuous improvement spirit, and it is this
spirit that has made Singapore such a successful, prosperous, efficient and productive country that is so highly regarded by
countries all around the world! Indeed, Singapore and we, wouldn’t be where we are today without you and your leadership.
You will always be in our hearts and we will miss you! Rest in peace. – Hiew Mon Xir

My Mom & Dad were from Muar, Johor and had settled down in Singapore back in the 50’s. During that time, Mr Lee was the Legal Advisor to the labour unions, following his graduation from Cambridge University. Mr Lee would later become our very first Prime Minister and build our Nation into what it is today.
When I was growing up, my Dad would always praise Mr Lee and share all the wonderful things Mr Lee did in building the
nation. When many of my Dad’s friends decided to return to Malaysia after the separation in 1965, my Dad never even
thought of following them. He asked how could he return to Malaysia when Mr Lee had given him work stability,
opportunities to raise his children well, and provided a good education system here in Singapore. Even after the sad event
happened on 13th May 1969, my Dad didn’t think of returning to Muar, his hometown. He said he owed it to Mr Lee to stay.
And since then the whole family knew what Mr Lee really meant to him. – Azman

A great leader – love for wife, love for family and love for the nation. Rest in Peace Mr Lee KY. – Lisa Lim

Singapore has always been synonymous with Mr Lee Kuan Yew, to the point where sometimes, we almost believed that he would live forever. His “never quit” attitude in bringing continuous success to Singapore through his great leadership is unforgettable. I am much impressed by the way he spoke to youngsters, awaking and arising minds with tremendous drive
spirit and energy in his speeches. I like this quote from him on what it means to be an educated man: “My definition of an educated man is a man who never
stops learning and wants to learn”. MY SALUTE TO THE GREAT MAN WHO WILL EVER LIVE IN THE HEARTS OF SINGAPOREANS AND ITS RESIDENTS – S. Seshadri

Mr Lee Kuan Yew, a genuine political giant, a man who fought long and hard against corruption and extremism, and
transformed a politically unstable tiny island with no natural resources, and threatened by communism in the early days, into
one of the wealthiest and most secured nations in the world. Words can never express how thankful we are for what you
have done and where you have placed us in the world. May you rest in peace and God bless! – Mohd Naseer

An irreplaceable leader. His passing on will leave a big dent in the hearts of all Singaporeans. Though we knew that this day
will come, it is still very painful to lose him. Whenever I travel overseas, there is never a moment that I do not feel proud to be
holding a Red Passport, and that is all due to him. Rest In Peace Mr Lee. – Seah Chui Lian

Because of you, I can hold my Singapore passport high in the air and tell the world that I am from Singapore and I am proud to
be Singaporean. Thank you, Mr Lee, for everything you have done for Singapore and all fellow Singaporeans. You will be
missed. – Larry Tay

Singapore is respected and recognised internationally as clean and green, safe, highly efficient, meritocratic; with minimal
corruption, good racial harmony, strong harmonious union-business relationships; is a key Asian financial hub, one of the
world’s busiest seaports, the best airport, one of world’s highest GDP, etc. From Third World to First, all these were achieved
in one generation. Thanks for everything and rest in peace, Mr Lee. – Tang Wing Fatt

It was your vision and leadership that led to the success which Singapore enjoys today. You have left an enduring legacy. My
family and I owe you a debt of gratitude, and you will be deeply missed. Thank you, Mr Lee! – Carolyn Khng

Thank you for all that you’ve done for Singapore. You will forever be in our hearts. We will always respect you. May you rest in
peace. – Deep in our hearts, Lina Wee

I am a great admirer of Mr Lee Kuan Yew. He has shown great vision and determination in bringing Singapore to its current
status – a truly remarkable achievement indeed. He will remain a role model for me for the rest of my life, especially having
experienced what Singapore is, first hand, over the last six and a half years. In this moment of sadness, I pray for him. – Sriram
Narayanan

Mr Lee’s passing is a great loss to Singapore. He was our David in the landscape of Super powers. Our great sage held in awe
and sought after by world leaders. Our pride and joy.
What he has done has taken much passion, grit and determination. Singapore’s success story is a feat which is hard to repeat
and replicate. I am proud to be part of this country where I can be assured of fair treatment, equal opportunity, safety and
freedom. But we can never take these for granted.
We should be always vigilant, think of our fellow men and strive for the betterment of each other. – Juniper Chua

Words will not suffice to express our gratitude. Even as we grieve, the outpouring of heartfelt community spirit in the Padang
queue, as one united people, stands testament to your life’s achievements. We are indeed blessed to have had you as the
founding Prime Minister. I salute you Sir, for your unwavering love for your wife and selfless passion for Singapore. Thank you
Mr Lee. – Jan Woon

They say history is made by great men and I truly believe so. Mr Lee rose amongst common men during the early tumultuous
years of Singapore’s independence and shouldered a nation’s hopes and dreams. He led the nation to her success through his
wisdom, foresight, grit and a deep conviction to better the lives of fellow Singaporeans. Today, we mourn the passing of a
great man. But, we seek comfort that his name shall forever be engraved in the history of Singapore. His vision shall be
propagated by every Singaporean. Thank you Sir, for everything you have done for us all. – Lim Bing Yao

We Singaporeans are blessed to have had such a great leader. We will not be where we are today without him. He fought for
us and spent his life building a successful Singapore. Everything he did and every decision he made, was for the good of
Singapore and its people. He left behind a huge legacy, and we will continue to build on what he left for us. Thank you so
much Mr Lee Kuan Yew!! – Ang Pei Pei

We are deeply saddened by the passing of Singapore’s visionary Founding Father, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Singapore is a small
country without natural resources. Mr Lee transformed Singapore from a third world country to a first world one which is
admired by world leaders. We are grateful for his immense contributions and the legacy he has left behind. We wish his soul
will rest in peace forever. – Mohd Asaduzzaman Chowdhury

Really, how do you thank someone who has taken an entire Nation from mudflats to metropolis, from insignificant to globally respected, from Third World to First, and all in one generation? He did not do it alone, but we couldn’t have done it without him either. Tributes have been pouring in in all shapes and forms from around the world, but no amount of words, song or dance will ever be enough to describe our gratitude. So when all is said and done, all we can really offer is a feeble “Thank you, Mr Lee”. Rest well in the knowledge that we will do our utmost to ensure that your Legacy lives on. – Simon Ang

In this period of national mourning, the scene created by thousands of Singaporeans – elderly, children and people of all races and religion – queueing up in an orderly manner & waiting for hours to pay their last respects to the Late Mr Lee, has greatly touched not only Singaporeans but the whole world. It seems that even in death, Mr Lee has helped make Singapore a more
united and stronger nation. One of the beliefs of Buddhism is that death gives rise to birth – if there were no death, there would be no birth, as this is part
of any life cycle. In this period of deep sorrow, the dream of all Singaporeans will be that the spirit, wisdom, vision, integrity, dedication and commitment of the late Mr Lee can be recycled back into this world so that there will be a better world tomorrow. Lastly, my deepest and heartfelt condolences to PM Lee and his family, as well as to all Singaporeans, for the loss of such a
great man. – Daniel Tan

Over the past few days, we have all taken time to stop and reflect on what MM Lee has done to bring Singapore from a third world country to where it is today. Through this process, I come to appreciate and understand the depth and enormity of what has become of Singapore which I have taken for granted all this while. I think this is an important point for us who have not personally experienced the drastic change from the mud lands of yesteryear to the modern and prosperous Metropolis of today. Singapore could have been a very different country and our lives could have been very different if not for Mr Lee. So
much of what we have today is because of what he had done for us all. In that sense, we did not so much earn but inherited what we have and for that, he is rightly called our founding father. As the nation mourns the death of Mr Lee this past week, his passing on has united our nation as I have never seen before.
Using the words of my pastor who put it so aptly, “During your life time, you forged us into a nation. At your death, you brought us together as a family”. These words capture this moment beautifully. I feel as if Singapore has once again discovered her identity as a people and as a nation. We have all been drawn into and have personalized the narrative of a nation which is unique and extraordinary. His death has in some ways “re-founded” Singapore. Thank you so, so much Mr Lee. You have our utmost respect and gratitude. – Lam Zheng Xin

In yesterday’s Special Parliamentary Sitting to pay tribute to the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Minister Ng Eng Hen recounted this of Mr Lee: In 1968, an MP asked in Parliament, how the British withdrawal would impact Singapore. Mr Lee told Singaporeans plainly that the British bases made up 20 per cent of the GNP and tens of thousands of jobs would be lost. To overcome this drastic impact, Singaporeans would have “to adapt and adjust, without any whimpering or wringing of hands, as a way of life which they have been accustomed to over 30 years comes to an end”. When another MP followed and asked if economic aid from the British could ease the effects of the pull-out, Mr Lee’s quick and unequivocal rejoinder was that any aid should “not make us dependent on perpetual injections of aid from the outside”, that “…we cannot change our attitude to life, that the world does not owe us a living and that we cannot live by the begging bowl. The best way of meeting the problem is to go about it quietly and intelligently discussing our problems in a low key and with as little fuss and bother as possible.” It is clear that Singapore would not have come this far without Mr Lee’s brilliant and decisive leadership. Mr Lee was a tough man, and he brought the country through tough times. As a child of the 80’s, I have grown up in relative peace and prosperity as compared to those before my time. The Singapore River was already clean and flanked by gleaming skyscrapers, and Singapore, with its gushing Merlion, had made it as a First World country that many in the region were envious (and some might say, jealous) of. In school, we were constantly reminded that we should not rest on the laurels of those before us, and that we should continue to work hard to progress our nation. Singapore has come this far by being stoic and pragmatic and industrious, and we should not lose these values. We are still today, a young nation and even as we remember the achievements that have been accomplished by those before us, more importantly we should remember that hardships can come in different forms. It is wise that we do not become complacent nor divisive, and continue to stand united as a one people to weather through thick and thin. Mr Lee shall remain always a great inspiration for my generation and generations to come. – Lee Hui Ying

When Mr Lee took over as PM of Singapore in the 1960s, our country was in bad shape. There were racial conflicts in neighbouring countries which also affected us. For the poorer citizens, the living standard was worse than “third world”. There were no natural resources to depend on. Jobs were difficult to find and the pay was not enough to survive on. Gang activities, robberies, bullying and thefts were rampant. Life was tough, with nothing much to look forward to. With his great leadership, farsighted vision and strategies, determination and guts, Mr Lee:
• United people of all races and religion with an efficient and honest government.
• Assembled our Total Defence capabilities when the British left us. This in turn gave us peace for the past 50 years.
• Upgraded our education system to suit the country’s needs, and attracted so many MNCs to invest here like “Magic”. Singapore prospered in just one generation under his leadership.
• Reclaimed land at Jurong Island, Tuas and other parts of Singapore to grow our economy.
• Pushed hard and improved the people’s lives by ensuring that eventually every citizen owns his own house. Infrastructures he built were extensively comprehensive, like the MRT, hospitals, expressways, reservoirs, etc.
• Succeeded in building the Best Airport in the World, the Best Airline in the World and the No. 1 Seaport in the world. He made us the third largest oil refining centre in the world.
• Made Singapore the safest place in the world to live in.
• Succeeded in seawater desalination and used-water recycling. We are now less dependent on imported water.
• Cleaned up the Singapore river

SLNG was built by his team to secure our energy needs in the future. The wonderful things Mr Lee did for Singapore will take us a very long time to put on record. Look around you, we are no
more without “natural resources” and poor. He has given us all we need. Although we are small, we have everything that other big countries have. The strong Singapore Dollar brings us to anywhere in the world we want to. Thank you very much Mr Lee. These few days, the feeling has been sad and a bit odd. Like a family member has been lost. – Neo Lye Hock

Dear founding father,
I am really sad to hear about your passing. I wish you could celebrate SG50 with us.
Thank you for leading us to build Singapore into a beautiful garden city and give us a bright future.
I will promise to study hard, contribute to the society and make you proud.
I love you and miss you always.

Who says Singapore has no personality?
During this entire week, I was deeply touched by the numerous heartwarming moments- people extending kindness to each other in the queue, helping the elderly, random conversations and smiles exchanged between strangers, the determination of Singaporeans to pay their last respect despite the long wait, fatigue or the hot sun. Not to mention, the kindness of volunteers passing down food and water, it made me felt so well taken care of. Even Singaporeans in other parts of the world have united to pay respect to our Father of the nation in the respective countries.


Today, as the cortege passed by, despite the really strong rain, people immediately put down their umbrellas and even squatted down so that those at the back could see the cortege. I was so touched, it was such consideration. After which, everyone spontaneously sang the National Anthem in the pouring rain. I felt like I was in a scene of a movie. It was so moving.

All these moments are so indescribable, it is AMAZING. I am sure many would have felt the same way I do.

What did we do to be blessed with such a great leader who put in so much hard work that we have what we have today. Not only this, our Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is such an endearing leader. He looked so tired, yet he still personally came down to the queue to thank the people. How blessed are we to have these 2 amazing leaders who cares so much for the nation.

Living in Singapore is like living in paradise. I truly feel so fortunate to be born a Singaporean; a country with caring leaders, a country that is determined, caring, giving, respectful and grateful.

Being on exchange has opened my eyes, for the Singapore I used to take for granted, I appreciate it dearly now. I remembered fondly how when I touched down at Changi Airport from exchange, I was so overwhelmed because I was finally back home. And there is no place like home. Actually, I do think Singapore has a personality, perhaps we are just too shy to express it.

“While we struggled before to define what it meant to be a Singaporean, we suddenly realized what it meant to be one.“

In the past week, we saw unity in spirit, first hand experienced these indescribable and heartwarming moments. Perhaps, this is Lee Kuan Yew’s last gift for us- one united people. May this Singapore spirit continue to burn and live in us. Our Father, Lee Kuan Yew would be very proud and happy to see that.
Esther Lee

Thank you Mr. Lee for your dedication and perseverance. Singapore today would not have come about without you and your visionary leadership.


I admire the ethics, principles and forward looking policies you practice and put in place, your discipline, thirst for knowledge and lifelong learning. Your never-ending passion and drive for Singapore, the difficult battles you fought and sacrifices you made for her cannot be revered enough. There is no person like you.

Lee Kuan Yew is Singapore and you made what Singapore is today, a developed nation, small yet packs a mighty punch, safe and peaceful yet brimming with opportunities, your incredible foresights and planning for the country and people, enabling us to be beneficiaries of your legacies.

No words can describe my gratitude, the emotions and sadness felt on your passing. You have fought a great battle Sir. Farewell and Rest in Peace.

Emily Tan

Dearest Mr Lee,
There is no words to describe how we feel about your passing. The only way to thank you is to keep moving forward to continue nurture what you have passed on to us. To keep you in our memories, to be united as a Nation as a Family. To live our lives with no regrets. Hard work and effort never betrays.


In the end it’s not the years in your life that count. It’s the life in your years.

Thanks to you Mr Lee, I am proud to be a Singaporean.

May I extend my heartfelt condolences to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his family on the loss of Mr Lee Kuan Yew.


Singapore is my adoptive home. I was a refugee from the Sino-Japanese War in China. Little did my parents realise that the Japanese would invade Singapore as well, in the Second World War. Born during war-torn years, I carry the name of An in Chinese, or Peace. If you had predicted a peaceful future for me at my birth, you would most likely be laughed at. However, in my new home in Singapore, and against all odds, peace has, in reality, been maintained since the end of WWII, largely through the far-sighted policies of Mr Lee.

We had split from Malaysia at our Independence and had nearly come to blows with Indonesia during Konfrontasi (1963-66), but, in the main, our multi-racial and multi-religious nation has pulled together in the face of adversity and imminent danger. Although Mr Lee has asked many sacrifices of us, we have lived up to his expectations in the hope of a better future. It looks almost as if the future has arrived in the present.

I could have ended up calling England, the USA, New Zealand or Malaysia my home but for fortuitous accidents which have root me to Singapore. I should be proud to die in the same country as Mr Lee – a lesser mortal perhaps, but sharing the honour he has brought to a country which he has created in a better world.

I am a Singaporean residing in the Netherlands for more than 10 years. My citizenship remains as Singapore. Because I feel very proud to be a Singaporean. Often, when I introduce myself at work or with friends, many people know Singapore and all the achievements. Some typical Singapore traits are the famous chewing gum ban; in the begin, people finds it amusing but later people see the need!


It was you, Mr. Lee who created a successful country and made us lift our heads up high where ever we are. I personally admire your wisdoms and the passion you have which gave you continued energy to fight for a world class country among our neighbours. I thank you sincerely.
Evelyn Ng

Dear Mr Lee, Sir


I have never met you but since your passing, I have watched your speeches and read much about you in this recent week. Like many Singaporeans, I felt an emotional attachment with you. I am deeply grateful for your tremendous dedication in building Singapore and your immense love and passion for her people. You are the blood that pulse through the veins of Singapore. You have taught is what 饮水思源 means – I now understand the source and importance of our water and appreciate the greenery we enjoy. I will always strife to behave like a first world citizen living in a first world oasis. May we endeavor to maintain this city in a garden as passionately as you did and teach our children to conserve our water supply. You leave behind a legacy that shall be passed on to many future generations to come. May your soul rest peacefully in heaven, your spirit lies in the hearts of Singaporeans. With deepest gratitude…

Dear Mr Lee
I am writing this from my room in a 3-room flat in Ang Mo Kio. I can own this home because of you, because of all you have stood for, believed in, sacrificed for. No amount of words can fully describe the depth of my gratitude. Your love and devotion to Mrs Lee has touch my heart so deeply, a love so true and committed. There are things that will be taught to us and will make such a deep impact, and these are not by words but by your actions, your living it out, the examples you set.
I am deeply honored, thankful, grateful, privilege to have you as the leader of Singapore. There will never be another Lee Kuan Yew like the one Singaporeans know.


Thank you, Mr Lee.

When I was a child, my father would insist that my sibling and I listen to Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s National Day Rally speeches on television. My father wanted us to learn to speak well (i.e. in grammatically-correct English), speak with conviction and hold the attention of an audience. I am not sure how much of these skills I have managed to develop over the years, but the memory of Mr Lee’s strength as an orator, his tenacity, and dedication to excellence will stay with me and continue to inspire me.

Dear Mr Lee,


Thank you for the sacrifices you had to make to build this nation and for the courage to stand up to your dissidents. You fought bravely for your convictions and did not “suffer fools”….and why should we indeed suffer those who do not place the highest good before our self-interest.

Ultimately choosing to benefit the masses will eventually benefit oneself as we are part of the same fabric.

You will always be larger than life itself and your passing on, while leaving a vaccum, does also leave a lasting and solid legacy for Singaporeans to sustain and improve upon with pride and competency.

Thank you once again for enabling us to take pride in being a Singaporean. Please continue to watch over us in your spiritual form and protect this island, our home.

Love & Light,
Sean Foo Suan An

Dearest Mr Lee,
I am deeply grief since 23 Mar 15. This whole week of mourning is extremely difficult as we still cannot accept the fact that you have left us. All of us wanted you to be present in SG50.


We have seen how you have transformed Singapore, battle all the challenges and fight against the odds for our independence. We are where we are now, because of you, our great and one & only founding father of Singapore.

You have spent all your life to build and to create Singapore. You have laid the foundation and have given us a country that we can call it our nation, a HDB housing that we can call it our home, a bilingual education that we can call it our strength, not forgetting our water supply and public transport, etc. We are the beneficiaries of your legacy.

It is a country that is well recognised and respected by all countries across the globe. You made us feel proud of our country and proud to be Singaporean. 感谢、感激、感恩.

As long as there is Singapore, there is Mr Lee Kuan Yew. We will always remember you in this generation, next generation and many generations ahead.

I am glad that I was able to pay my last resoect to you at the Parliament House , pen tributes at Raffles Institutions and Tanjong Pagar Community Centre, involved in your funeral service on 29 Mar 15 at the beginning and at the end.of the route.

Current PM (Lee Hsien Loong ), we know this week has been extremely difficult for you.. It is going to be very challenging for you going forward to carry on with your beloved father’s legacy and to build on it to the next level . You can make it. Take care and 加油!

Dear Mr. Lee Kuan Yew,
I am 61 years old and have experienced the growth of Singapore since the day you shouldered the unenviable responsibilities of building our tiny island nation. It was a monumental task with no room for error. We had no industries, no agriculture, high unemployment rate, racial tension, low literacy rate, not-so-nice neighbors and practically no foreign reserves to speak of. Many of our neighbors were waiting to see us fail. We didn’t. You led us out of the swamps and built Singapore into a 1st world country in less than 50 years. Your vision, perseverance, determination, intelligence and raw courage saw us through. What you did was much more than a miracle. Sometimes I wonder whether you have a crystal ball.


You built Singapore on all fronts which enabled us to overcome any obstacles from any directions. To call you a giant among men is an understatement. You are a true nation builder who is rarely seen in history. We fortunate to have you.

To thank you for what you did is hardly enough but I assure you that we will continue your good works and keep you in our hearts and minds at all time.

Rest in Peace, Mr. Lee.
Norman Lim

Dear Mr. Lee
Thank you for the many things you have done for Singapore.
I feel that your biggest contribution to Singapore is leading Singapore to independence. You had made a lot of effort to make Singapore what it is today, from a third world country to this famous red dot. You never gave up this country when times were bad. Instead, you worked even harder, leading Singaporeans through ups and downs. I cannot thank you enough for whatever you had done for our country, making it glow in just a few decades. Always remembering you, founding father of Singapore, in our hearts.
Lu Xue’er, Cadee (Pasir Ris Primary School)

Where the wild wind blows
Where my heart stilled
Under the blanket of sorrows
Beckons me within
The days of passing
The days of mourning
Torturous to mine soul
Where the wild wind blows


Rest In Peace Sir

Dear Mr Lee, thank you for all your hard work and sacrifices you have given to Singapore. There are no words that can express my gratitude and respect I have for you. You have devoted your whole life carving a nation, not for yourself, but for the people of Singapore and our future generations. 50 years ago you shed your tears for Singapore, now we Singaporeans and other parts of the world are shedding their tears for the loss of a true giant leader. It will be very hard to find another remarkable world leader like yourself Mr Lee. Without you, there will be no modern Singapore. Singapore would still be a little red dot among the other big nations. Now Singapore is a big commercial hub, being able to work collaborately with the other big nations in the world. You are not only a widely respected leader but also a kind hearted and soft man, whom many older generations have shared their beautiful encounters they had with you. You will be remembered for many generations to come. Thank you once again Mr Lee. Rest in peace.
S H KOH

I am in that generation of fortunate Singaporeans who have benefited the most from Mr Lee’s leadership. We did not suffer through the formative years of the nation in the early sixties and were largely shielded from the difficulties that the nation faced after Singapore’s separation from Malaysia. Yet, we have benefited from being in a safe and secure English speaking nation with a good quality of life. We benefited from the meritocratic policies which allowed us to train in our chosen profession-medicine. We were sent overseas to the best centres in the world to train with government support. We returned to a much admired healthcare system to do good work. Thank you Mr Lee for our little country that is big in the world’s eyes, for our lives and for giving us a livelihood and a future. May you rest in peace.
Andrew Khoo

Dear Founding Father Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


Thank you for making it possible for my grandparents and parents to make it through the hardships of olden Singapore. For that, I am grateful to you, for I will not be here writing this piece of tribute without your wise leadership for your people.

You do not know me for who I am, but it does not matter. I know what you have done for us. That is, well, important. You built Singapore to be clean, green, efficient and organised for the benefit for all of us. This has made me so proud to be part of Singapore. Maybe this is why I had decided to join the civil service 13 years ago, and I never looked back since. You paved the road for my generation, so that we can do more to continue your legacy.

I was deeply saddened as I listened to PM Lee addressed the nation about your demise on 23 March. It must be really hard for him. It was, for me. I came to the realisation that you are, so much a part of my life, only with your passing on. Indeed, I felt as if an important piece of my beautiful puzzle has gone missing. When I paid my respects to you this morning at the Parliament House, finally, I could choke back my tears no more.

Thank you, Sir, for all your hard work and giving your all, your life, to us. We will stay strong. May you rest in peace.

My deepest condolences to PM Lee and the family of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

Buan Hui Ni

Dear Mr Lee,


We would like to thank you for building up Singapore so that we could walk with pride and dignity as Singaporean, able to stand up against our peers in the world.

The Singapore branding has come to be associated with efficiency, trustworthiness and honesty. It is these traits that allow us to punch above and beyond what a small country could do.

In a way the history of Singapore Urological Association mirrors the history of Singapore. We are but a small group of urologists compared to the other Asian countries, let alone the rest of the world. Under the meritocratic system you have created and armed with scholarship by the government, we were sent to top medical centres in the world to learn new skills and technology so that we could bring them back to Singapore and use it for the good of our people. It also helps to put Singapore at the cutting edge of medicine and biotechnology, far beyond most Asian countries. The ties that we have established with experts overseas further seal our fame as a leading regional centre for medical excellence.

We always look beyond the shores of Singapore as you have always proposed and thus our annual local meeting had expanded to become a regional type meeting with overseas experts coming over to share their knowledge, an opportunity that is hard to come by unless you fly over to the Americas or Europe.

Thank you Mr Lee for building up a stable and cohesive nation, gives us immense opportunities beyond our imagination and expand our horizon to look further than our own limitation.

Rest in peace, Sir.

Dear Mr. Lee Kuan Yew,
You had been an inspiration and the pride of all Singaporeans. We cannot thank you enough for your wholehearted contribution to Singapore and Singapore will not be what it is today without You.


Thank you for the tears you wept when we separated from Malaysia. Thank you for the hard work in achieving racial harmony, meritocracy and economic stability. Thank you for believing in your people and leading us for many decades no matter how desperate the situation seemed. Thank you for always putting Singapore’s interest first, always looking out for her until the very end.

Sir, you will be dearly missed and Singapore will never be the same without you. May you rest in peace and continue believing in us, your people, as we work hard for an even brighter Singapore. God bless you.
Rey Chen

I was born on 26th Oct 1955 – Pioneer Generation, 2nd Class


I grew up during the tumultuous years of pre and post independence, experienced the racial riots first hand as fighting and killings happened just outside my primary school compound while we were in class, the separation from Malaysia, the British pullout and much more.

I first saw Mr Lee Kuan Yew when my father brought me, a young boy of 7 or 8 years old, to listen to him speak somewhere near the old Change Alley area (I can’t remember exactly where). The first thing that struck me was his booming voice and his body actions, especially his hands, and his facial expressions. He spoke powerfully and with emotion. I did not fully understood the meaning of what was spoken but he gave me the impression that he was a leader, a great leader, that he was someone who would fulfill his promises, someone who would guide us and take care of us and fight for us.

All through the years, my impression of him had not changed from the above. In fact, as I grew up, became more mature and was exposed to lives and conditions in other countries I began to appreciate Mr Lee Kuan Yew even more. His vision and foresight, his belief in himself, his team and his people, his determination to accomplish whatever he sets out to do or achieve, his meticulous planning to achieve his goals for the country, his righteousness and much much more.

What he has instilled most in me, and I believe in most Singaporean of my generation is the need to continually strive to be the best through hard work, honesty, self-sacrifice and compassion to compliment the skills and intelligence needed to perform any job, any role. Most of all, I will forever remember what he had been drumming to all of us from the first day, that we must continually strive not only to be, but to remain, “one united people regardless of race, language or religion”.

Mr Lee Kuan Yew, go in peace knowing that you had achieved what you set out to do and much much more. You had put in place both the hardwares as well as the softwares for the current and future generations of Singaporeans to thrive.

Thank you and God Bless!
Peter Soh


尊敬的國父李光耀先生


五六十年代，您是我們的鬥士，帶領新加坡爭取獨立； 六七十年代，您成為驅動者，帶領我們拼經濟，搞建設； 七八十年代，您有如商人，帶領我們走出國門到海外投資； 九十年代，您明智的交棒給下一代領導班子而成為我們的護航者； 您為這個國家和人民做得太多。。。太多了！ 是時候我們必須負起責任繼續傳承您所奠定的國策和永垂不朽的精神； 安息吧國父，望您在天之靈看到您的子民是多麼的尊敬和愛戴您！

Kor Ter Ming

Dear Sir,
I regret that I was not able to bid you farewell. Nonetheless I stayed up late in a bid to watch the live stream of your funeral.


Sir, you are an inspiration to us all. Singapore did not deserve you, it was too small a stage for you. I do not know what Singapore did to deserve you, but it was our luck that we did. I thank you, founding father, for the security and the prosperity you have brought to our nation. Whilst your policies were never short of critics, many of us have benefited from them unknowingly. Sir, even whilst people of my generation have been said to be unacquainted to the trials and the hardship your generation has been through to secure our future, your legacy lives on in us. For that, we are forever grateful. Indeed, without your work on Singapore, many of us would not be where we are.

Sir, there will never be another like you. Singapore was too small a stage. Even many have known your name but not Singapore’s. Yet, we, your people, will remember you not merely for your wit and your combative nature, your frankness and honesty that has earned the respect of world leaders, but we will remember you for the life that you have sacrificed to build this country from scratch, for the tears you shed for us. Today, we shed tears for your passing.

Sir, if not for you, i would not be in the UK studying law now. I have seen you only once whilst having a lunch at Raffles Hotel. I remember being surprised at how tall you were. Sir, even though I do not know you personally, I will aspire to live by your virtues. And even though I have not witnessed first hand the development you have brought to Singapore, I am grateful for the comfort that I was born into. Singapore lives on, a grateful people who will continue your legacy.

Sir, you were too big for Singapore. We never deserved you. You were not a man of God, but perhaps you were a man from God. Sir, we will fly the flag proudly wherever we are, wherever we are planted.

Rest in peace, we will continue your legacy.
Gabriel

A man whose fearless character and love for the nation will never be forgotten.


A voice that spoke foresight, that understood the vitality of change, perseverance and resilience to continuously improve ourselves and our country.

A heart that lead with our other founding fathers, the hope for the succession of better days, security and community.

A founding father and inspirational leader whose legacy lives on in each and every Singaporean.

**

What we remember of who Lee Kuan Yew was, is what he himself would have wanted each of us to be; for our nation, for our home, for our loved ones and for ourselves.

May we find it within each of ourselves to do the same for future generations, the way we look back in heartfelt gratitude to what one man’s life and his team painstakingly and tirelessly strived for us.

May the Lord continue to watch and shower blessings upon Singapore and her people, as we continue to evolve together to build each other up in love, kindness and generous community. In Jesus’ name, amen.

Dear Sir,
We like to express our heartfelt gratitude and sincere appreciation for all that you have done for Singapore.
Like many others, we also belong to the generations who have not undergo much hardships or sufferings like our pioneers. Regretably, we only got to know you better now. Within the short five days of mourning, we learnt a lot – of how hard you had fought for the nation, the numerous intriguing & wise speeches you made, as well as the sentimental side of you.
You have definitely made enormous contributions to our society. Without you, we will not have this safe, beautiful, leading global city we called home.
Your wisdom & vision, along with endless determination & selflessness, have made Singapore a country we are all proud of. We are truly thankful beyond words…


Dear Sir, may you rest in peace. We will continue to be a good Singapore citizen and your legacy will be passed down to our children. We will remember you forever.

Yours sincerely,

Our founding father, your passing is a loss to Singapore – a land that you have lived, led and loved. A great leader, you selflessly led with your tenacity, foresight and brought this once little dot on the earth surface to a successful, thriving and prosperous world-known first class nation.
A strong advocate in equality, you strive for living together harmoniously in diversity, and reached out to everyone, regardless of race, language or religion. Your faith, persistence and great foresight during your reign still continue to benefit and allow us, your fellow Singaporeans, to reap benefits, from your sacrifice and labour.
My father once said,”Both your mother and I are lowly educated, yet we have a home to call our own, and two children who are educated and successful. We owe it to Mr Lee. He has contributed to a roof over our head, a stable ground for us to rely on in times of crisis, and he raised my children up well.”
A man of great strength and leadership in the political realm, you show us not just your love for Singapore, but also to your courage to display your tender loving care as a sentimental man to your late wife. Indeed, a sign of a man’s strength is how gently he loves his wife. I am deeply touched by how sweet and loving you are to the woman behind your back all these years – your very own pillar of support.
Just like how you celebrate the life of your late wife with your touching eulogy, we, your Singaporeans, your fellow countrymen and women, celebrate your life today.
Your contribution to Singapore can never be simply summed up in these few words and so does my gratitude to you. Without you, there will be no Singapore like today.
Thank you for gracing us with your lifetime.

Dear Mr Lee,
Few years ago, my family and I were living in Shanghai due to my husbands work. As a Singaporean living abroad, I kept connected to my homeland through constant updates on news and articles on the Internet.
As I see less and less of you in public appearances, I tell myself that should the day come, I will fly back home to personally send you off.
The good news is, my husband got posted back mid 2013 and it was a relief to be able to still catch you on TV a couple of times.
So on the first day of your lying in state. I was determined to go regardless of being told the arduous wait. As I was getting ready my 10 year old son said he wish to tag along, even though he knew the wait was 4 hours or more. I was touched. He asked me what to wear, I pondered for a while and told him to dress as if meeting Mr Lee in person. Without a word he dashed to his room and in few minutes came out in his suit which he wore for his solo guitar performance. I was totally stunned and asked him why he chose that attire. His reply was I quote “He was the Prime Minister! I have to look my best!” Trying hard to hold back my emotion, I told him it’s good that he thinks that way but we would be standing in the hot son for a while so will be too much to be in so many layers. Reluctantly he changed into something less formal, but still nothing short of long sleeves and long pants.
During the 4 hours wait, my son who is an iPad freak didn’t say a word about being bored, not even the slightest attempt to ask if he can use my iPhone to entertain himself. All he brought was a box of nerd candy, which he constantly poured a few every now n then to pop into his mouth.
When it was finally our turn, words can’t even describe the mixed feelings I had. Gratitude, admiration, sadness, emptiness, all filled me up in that short 30 seconds we stood in front of your coffin. As I choked up we bowed and said our goodbyes.


Mr Lee thank you again for all that you have done, we will miss you dearly, you will live in our hearts forever.
May you rest in peace.

This week, Singapore declared a national week of mourning.
This week, Singapore was deeply saddened by your passing.
This week, hundreds of thousands of Singaporeans formed the longest queue along Singapore River and Padang to pay tribute to you.
But to me,
This week marks a celebration of your life.
This week is an awakening week for the younger generation to understand how you have transformed Singapore from nothing to everything that we take for granted.
This week, our hearts are truly connected as One, the people are united as One.
This week marks the most remarkable and impactful week for Singapore in 2015.
No single SG50 celebration event can be as meaningful as this week.
I was born in 1965 and I am proud to be part of Singapore’s growth, and to be able to witness the transformation of Singapore as well.
No words can express my gratitude to you, dear Founding Father. THANK YOU.
You will be deeply missed and dearly cherished in our hearts for years…
Prayers to PM Lee and family.
Rachel Lee

Thank you, Mr Lee, for making Singapore a success – for sowing the seeds and ploughing the land so that we, the following generations, are able to enjoy the shade and the fruits those trees bear. And it is probably fitting to say so seeing how you were a firm believer in turning Singapore into a city in a garden. We are, without a doubt, extremely fortunate to have been blessed with a group of founding fathers who managed to turn Singapore into a modern miracle through sheer tenacity, logic and foresight, and all that Singapore has become is definitely the result of their hard work.
Thank you, Mr Lee, for inspiring the following generations to follow in your footsteps and keep pushing Singapore to greater heights, for we know that this country that you’ve built on all your life is capable of even more.
Thank you, Mr Lee, for this country that I can proudly call home. Your contributions to this nation will never, and can never, be forgotten. Even after many generations, we would still be remembering the humble beginnings of this fishing village, and through it all, the mastermind of a modern metropolis.
Thank you, Mr Lee, for all that you’ve dedicated your life to. May you rest in peace.
Ho Wan Qi

Dear Mr Lee
I first came to Singapore in 1989 for my first job after leaving my hometown in Ipoh. Since then, I never looked back. I admire the values and principles that you integrate in your administration of the nation. The fairness and equality of each citizens regardless of race, religion, background, etc….To me, Singapore is Lee Kuan Yew and Lee Kuan Yew is Singapore. I cannot imagine a Singapore without you.
At times, I envy the people of Singapore for having you as their leader. I admire your passion, and your desire, grit and determination to make Singapore a better place to live in; a place you can call home. You lived simply but with a big heart!
I am truly glad that I get to live in a Singapore with your presence for more than two decades. You will be missed but your spirit will continue to motivate the people of Singapore to continue growing this nation that you have built with your life.
Thank you Mr Lee Kuan Yew, thank you for Singapore. You have done remarkably well, beyond words can described.
Happy reunion with your wife and rest in peace Sir!
H. Wong


I am extremely grateful to Sir Lee Kuan Yew. I wouldn’t be where I am and my family wouldn’t be where we are, if not for Sir Lee Kuan Yew’s forward-looking policies.
My father chose to make Singapore his home because he felt this is where his children will get the best education with no fear of cultural dilution since Singapore is strongly rooted in Asian values. My father used to say and still says, Lee Kuan Yew has made this place a land of opportunity – you must work really hard and make the most of every opportunity you get. He has made Singapore a place where anyone can reach their true potential. This is not true in most countries across the world. You must respect this and be grateful for what you have received. You must create so much value in whatever work you do that Singapore is proud of you.
Sir Lee Kuan Yew, your governance standards, your policies, your speeches, your personality, your contribution, your life, was, is and shall be an inspiration and example for many generations to come.
My family and I thank you for being who you were.
May God bless your soul and grant you eternal peace and rest.

Dear Mr Lee,
I belong to the generation that got to enjoy the luxury of everything that you did and still, get to see you, pay my utmost and final respect to you and together with all Singaporeans, joined you on your last journey with us. No words can explain how fortunate I am, how grateful and how blessed I am to be a part of this. Nothing could change what you mean to Singaporeans. We Singaporeans will always remember you.


Writing this is the only thing that I can do to show how much I really appreciate as a Singaporean. There is nothing that we can do to be worth comparing to everything that you’ve given up for us. It is not even comparable to 0.01% of what you did for us. We’re eternally grateful and we’ll never be able to repay what you’ve done. It is only apt that we follow your values, pass it on and keep Singapore going. Because that’s the only thing that we can do and we’ll still be indebted to you.

There’re still so much more I needed to learn about Singapore’s history. I never had been through what my grandparents did. Despite not being able to witness your fights and rallies from the start, I’m still thankful as I can read all of these from the books – because of our wonderful education system. And I know that you did so much for us. I will study them and keep all these in my heart and pass it on to my future generations.

Thank you for building Singapore to where we are now. We’ll never be where we are without you. Maybe at your last moments, you were still pinning about Singapore. But we Singaporeans will definitely hold up to your values and ensure that we’ll have SG100, SG150, SG200 and definitely more to come.

We know that, noYEWnoUS. We’ll stay yew-nited as one. Cause we know that we’ll fall if we’re divided. Thank you for your determination and perseverance and believing in Singapore. Your dedication to the nation we call home is immeasurable and you’ll continue to live as a legacy in the hearts of all Singaporeans for generations to come. No amount of gratitude could explain how thankful I am for all your contributions, incredible foresights and diligence that let us to a thriving cosmopolitan country. Please continue to watch over Singapore. We’ll do you proud.

Farewell to the Singapore’s father, goodbye to our 阿公. Till we meet again, some day some how. May your soul rest in peace.

You toiled for our homeland, led the people through turbulent times. You fought for independence for the people, built a nation when there was none and gave us an identity.
Without you, we will never have the chance to celebrate National Day on 9 August, sing our own national anthem and recite our own pledge.
Through your vision, leadership, determination and passion, you have successfully put a hardly visible little red dot called Singapore on the global map in less than 50 years.
You gave us not only a country but a nation, a home that we are proud of. You made sure everyone has a home to live in, gave us education, built schools, provided us with Total Defence, ensuring that our children are well brought-up in a safe environment. You instilled responsibility in every one of us that we are responsible to protect our own loved ones and assets. You gave us a multi-racial society, where everyone here is equal.
I am proud to tell my foreign friends that I am not just a Chinese man.
I AM A SINGAPOREAN.
Thank you MR LEE KUAN YEW for your lifelong contributions. You gave your life for the people. Your legacy will live forever, the future generations will know of your wonderful work.
May you rest in peace.

Thank you Mr Lee Kuan Yew!
Thank you for your love and dedication for Singapore. I feel so blessed to have you with us, walking so closely with Singapore each and every day of your life. With your meticulous planning and consideration, you had paved a beautiful landscape for our nation. I really love the greenery on our sunny island! Since young, one of my favourite campaigns is “Tree Planting Day” in November. I always find it especially meaningful. With one man to plant a tree, many will do the same. Years after years, Singapore has eventually beautified herself with more flora and fauna. Thank you!
You had inspired me in many ways! For many unpleasant events that had happened in the past, you had forgiven many and even made friends with them. I’ve learnt from you on what you had shared- “Be diligent. Keep learning ongoing! 勤奋好学。活到老，学到老。Never neglect the needy。Forward Looking! Let action speaks louder than words!” I’ll surely plant them deep rooted in my heart and will work towards them. Thank you!
With your basic belief in values of respect, honesty, integrity and sincerity, you had genuinely touched and transformed so many lives in Singapore and around the world. I am definitely moved by your sincerity and frankness on how you had dealt with each problem in a realistic perspective. You were indeed an extraordinary leader who had led and cared for your people in Singapore. When you said “I am accountable for my people..” , it had truly moved me to tears. Thank you!
I admired your faith and courage. Your faith to believe Singapore will make it! Your courage to make things happen- in making a successful and prosperous Singapore! Thank you for spending a lifetime of yours for us and our nation. Thank you!
This is my little promise- as a humble educator, I will strive to do my very best to make Singapore’s next generation to take pride as a Singaporean! To share with them the important values in life.


You had made a great difference in our lives and we are extremely grateful for what you had done for us! Thank you!
We will continue to stay strong and move on with courage. FORWARD TOGETHER SINGAPORE!
THANK YOU Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
Yours Sincerely,
with a true Singaporean love,

没有您当初的建国理念,坚持和对国家的信心与爱,就没有现在新加坡的国与家。尊敬的李光耀先生,我们的建国总理,感恩您为新加坡付出的一切。谢谢您为我们创造了一个安居乐业的家园。身为后代的我们更要珍惜这些得之不易的建国成果。我们须更努力与进步,让国家变得更好以报答您对国家的贡献。感谢您,我们的国父,李光耀先生。

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
In a world where so much is promised but so little delivered, you stand out for delivering so much with so little at your disposal. Singapore owes you a debt of eternal gratitude.


Thank you sir, and farewell.

Dear Sir,
Thank you for everything that you have done for this country, and her people. I am fortunate to have been born into the time where people were enjoying the fruits of our forefathers’ labours under your leadership and guidance. Because of your vision and your team’s efforts, our people can enjoy the comforts that perhaps sometimes we forget are not a given, but are the results of decades of hardwork during an era unknown to those of us who did not experience it. Thank you for everything you have contributed to Singapore in your lifetime.


Even at your passing, some years after you left the public office, you continue to give Singapore and its people an important lesson – a lesson on unity. That it is possible for a nation to come together, no matter who we are to achieve something together. The number of people, from all walks of lives, coming together for one sole reason of paying their last respects to you, is testament to this, and more importantly, how much we appreciate and love you for all that you have done. I only hope we will not disappoint you and our forefathers, and will continue to bring brightness and glory to the legacy you have left behind.

Rest in peace Sir, as you are united once again with the love of your life. My deepest condolences goes to PM Lee and his family as he and our nation go through this time of grief over your loss.

With a grateful heart,
Pingshan Huang

I was born in 1997 and had never gotten the chance to meet Mr Lee Kuan Yew, yet his legacy was well known throughout the country. It is really regretful that Mr Lee passed away in the year of Singapore’s golden jubilee but have faith that he is in a peaceful place now and looking over SIngapore fondly.


Even though I heard in the morning that Mr Lee had passed away, the significance did not really hit me as hard until I went to school and suddenly realise that our founding father has passed away. Even though he ended his Prime Minister service before I was born, even though I’ve never actively interacted with a great man like him before – a real pity actually – yet tears welled in my eyes and I never knew I could feel so much for a man I’ve never met.

But even though he’s a man I’ve never met, he’s THE man who built all I have today. Clean water and sanitation, education, housing, a green country; the successes of Singapore were all brought by Mr Lee.

It was really heartbreaking to see Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong during his speech announcing the death of his father. It must be really hard on him and I send my condolences.

Our Singapore spirit shines brightly throughout during this mourning period. Many queued to pay their respects and some made unique tributes for the late Mr Lee. I hope that from where Mr Lee is now, he can see what he built coming together and glowing as a country.

We grieve as a nation for the loss of a great man. We grieve as a nation for the loss of a father.

Yet, we eternally honour, respect and send our greatest gratitude for he who have sacrificed his whole life for us and the Singapore he has built today.

May you rest in peace forever, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, we will do our best to sustain your legacy, we are proud Sin
