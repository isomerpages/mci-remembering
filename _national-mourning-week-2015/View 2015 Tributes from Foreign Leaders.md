## View 2015 Tributes from Foreign Leaders

#### ASEAN Secretary-General, Le Luong Minh
ASEAN Secretary-General Le Luong Minh joined other world leaders in mourning the loss of Lee Kuan Yew, the first Prime Minister of Singapore, who passed away yesterday at 91. In a letter addressed to Lee Hsien Loong, Prime Minister of Singapore and son of Lee Kuan Yew, Secretary-General Minh conveyed his “deepest condolences” on the passing of the late Prime Minister.

In his letter, Minh described Lee Kuan Yew as “a great statesman who had built Singapore with his vision, wisdom and courage.” The ASEAN Secretary-General also acknowledged the late Prime Minister as one of those “instrumental in the establishment of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations” in 1967. Singapore is one of ASEAN’s five founding members and together with the other leaders, he has provided guidance to ASEAN in its formative years.
For three decades, Lee Kuan Yew dedicated his life to the success of his country and is widely recognised as the architect of Singapore’s transformation from a small port town 50 years ago to one of the world’s wealthiest countries. Secretary-General Minh noted that the late Prime Minister “has left a lasting legacy not only for Singapore but also for ASEAN and he will be greatly missed.”

#### Defence Minister of Indonesia, General (Retired) Ryamizard Ryacudu
“Every time I came for a meeting with the Singapore Army, he would definitely invite me for talks. I was shocked the first time. I was only the Army Chief. He was more senior than the prime minister. But he wanted to speak to me – not once but five times,” said General (Retired) Ryamizard.

“I regard him as a true statesman. He did not discriminate against anyone. He spoke from the heart and I responded likewise. He was sincere in his views. And I responded with sincerity. We understood each other,” he added.

General (Retired) Ryamizard likened his discussions with Mr Lee to those between a father and son. He said Mr Lee’s honesty and sincerity laid the foundation for good ties between Indonesia and Singapore’s armed forces.

“We must talk to each other, whatever the issues may be. There’s nothing hidden, because we know he is sincere, forthright. The rest of us followed the same,” said General (Retired) Ryamizard.

“From earlier on, Indonesia and Singapore conducted joint military exercises annually. The two armies took turns to host. Similarly, for the air force and navy. It has been going on well. That’s a result of the foundations laid from the top. That’s how it was between Mr Lee and President Suharto,” he added.


#### EU Ambassador to Singapore, Dr Michael Pulch
p>I wish to express my heartfelt sympathy to his family and the people of Singapore for the passing away of Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

He was an inspiring statesman whose vision of an independent and prosperous Singapore became the foundation of its lasting success.

Throughout his political life generations of European leaders did seek his views and advice to better understand dynamics in this part of the world. He will be deeply missed.

– Dr Michael Pulch, EU Ambassador to Singapore

Every 30 minutes, the four guards near the casket will change shifts. There are 60 vigil guards in total.

This young girl came with her parents to thank Mr Lee. When she arrived, observers saw her rush to the board and tip-toe to pick up a marker. Without hesitation, she proceeded to draw a circle bigger than her heart and penned a message to Mr Lee.

This is what she said:

“Dear Mr Lee, Thank you for everything I have today, my flat, my education, my famili/s (sic) peaceful times when everywhere in this world people worry about basic necessities. I am the first in my family to be able to complete my education and is the first graduate, to my parents who are near illiterate. Thank you for changing our lives.”

Mr Lee Kuan Yew not only touched the lives of Singaporeans, but also the lives of many who came to work in Singapore. Upon hearing of Mr Lee’s passing, these former workers set up their own tribute site back in Tamil Nadu, India, to pay their respects.

Paying Tribute to One Man in Diverse Ways
The widely-familiar image of a black ribbon framing Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s profile has birthed car decals, badges, T-shirt logos, stickers and more. Created by Member of Parliament Alex Yam and his team, the logo was also printed on 1,000 customised balloons, produced by a group of Singaporeans and Singapore Permanent Residents who were brought together by a common sense of grief and a wish to honour the late Mr Lee. The passing of founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew saw a nation coming together to both honour and mourn, in a myriad of manner and form. It would not be possible to put together an exhaustive list of tributes conceptualised and paid; the following are but some of the highlights.

Creativity also came in the form of light tributes, such as the one displayed on the external façade of Fullerton Hotel.


A Final Send-off: Crowds Line State Funeral Procession Route
The skies opened and heavy rain fell on the crowds lining the State Funeral procession route. However, they were not deterred and stayed put, determined to bid a final farewell to Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Heeding the calls to dress in either black or white, members of public at the Padang armed themselves with umbrellas and ponchos and waited patiently in the downpour for the departure of the gun carriage bearing Mr Lee’s casket from Parliament House. Thousands lined the streets from St Andrews Road to Shenton Way, Cantonment Road to Clementi Road, bearing the Singapore flag in an emotional send-off.

Even as the rain poured, Singaporeans braved the elements, lining the streets to catch a glimpse of the funeral procession and gathering at various Community Tribute Sites with their fellow Singaporeans to witness the State Funeral Service for Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

The mood was sombre as the cortege made its way to the University Cultural Centre, where 10 eulogies were delivered. Many could not hold back their tears as the nation bids its final farewell to the leader who built Singapore.

Tributes continued to flow in even during the final moments.

The week of national mourning saw Singaporeans across all ages and races, and from all walks of life come together to celebrate Mr Lee’s lifetime of achievements, grieve for his passing and relive moments of our history.

In his passing, Mr Lee Kuan Yew once again united the nation as only he can. As Singaporeans joined our voices to recite the pledge and sing the national anthem, it is clear that we are more determined than ever to safeguard the legacy that he has left behind.

At the Pasir Ris Punggol Community Tribute Site, one senior who had never had the benefit of a formal education, asked a young volunteer to help her write down her thoughts before she could sign it off. It was a heartfelt tribute to Mr Lee.  Parents encouraged their children to leave words of appreciation, knowing that they would understand the poignancy of Mr Lee’s passing and his immense contributions to Singapore, in time to come.

Paying Tribute to Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s Role in Building a Harmonious Society

While Mr Lee Kuan Yew was Lying-in-State, religious and community leaders came together to remember Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s legacy in promoting harmony between different races and faiths.

 

Archbishop William Goh led a 5000-strong Catholic community in a mass at St. Joseph’s Church on Friday to pay tribute to Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Archbishop Goh noted that Mr Lee had a deep respect for people of all faiths and was a staunch advocate of inter-religious dialogue, although he professed himself an agnostic.

In his Friday sermon at Muhajirin Mosque, Uztaz Irwan Hadi Md Shuhaimy said that Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his team worked hard to develop Singapore into a prosperous country. This was achieved through the harmonious relationship between people of different races, economic development and an excellent education system.

 

Minister for Communications and Information Dr Yaacob Ibrahim, who was also at the mosque for the Friday prayers, said that Mr Lee was always very concerned about what was happening with the Malay-Muslim community and would always ask “What more can be done?”

Over 2000 worshippers took part in a prayer session organised by the Singapore Buddhist Federation at the Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery on Thursday.

To Mr. Lee and his Family:


We’re deeply saddened by the demise of Mr. Lee.
Our condolences goes to the members of his family.

Mr. Lee lived upto 91.

To live upto 84 years itself is a life well lived and complete life. 84 years will mean, life lived to witness 1008 new/full moon(s).

May Mr. Lee rest in peace.
Thanks for his wonderful leadership during his stay in Singapore.

We understand LIFE is eternal, only body leaves.
Mr. Lee, if there is such as reincarnation for you, please come back to Singapore.

Thanks!
RengaNathan & Family.


Dear Mr Lee
I came to Singapore 16 years ago to pursue my tertiary education because i firmly believe that i will do well in a society that is built based on meritocracy. Not only i completed my study here in NTU, but received scholarship from MOE to pursue further education in MIT.


I had a short encounter with you during my day in NTU. It is a moment that i cherish in my heart because i have learn so much from that encounter.

If it is not you and your effort to build a nation based on meritocracy, i will not be able to see the world and achieve so much in my life.

Me, my family, and our generations to come will make our mark in the history on this green earth and make you proud.

Thanks for your effort and contribution to the nation,

Rest well. May god bless your and rank your soul among the righteous
Your Fellow Singaporean
Choong Chee Huei and Family

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


Thank you for what you have done for Singapore. Your outstanding leadership gave us the direction in transforming Singapore from Third World to First, as well as the guts to believe we could achieve that.

I will always remember your wisdom and conviction in ensuring Singapore’s success. Some lessons that you taught me (through your books) are:

1. Non-corruption is critical to success

2. A leader must always think in the best interest of his people, and not be easily swayed by others’ opinions

3. A leader must be bold in order to realise his vision

4. One should live his/her life with determination, discipline, based on good values, with no worries over what others would think, and with no regrets

I feel that the best way to honour you and show my respect is to remember your wisdom, and continue to do my part in improving Singapore as well as our society.

Thank you, Sir.

Rest in peace.
Ivan Yeo

My heartfelt thanks to our forefather, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Without him, Singapore will not be at where she is today. He has turned a third world country into one of the finest country in this entire world. All in a few decades. Seeing so many stories of him and his leadership and sacrifices made me appreciate everything we have in Singapore. All I ever hope for is that we will not forget what he has done for us, that we will not stray from what he has set for us in this country, that we will continue to let Singapore flourish and move to even greater heights. Mr Lee Kuan Yew is an extraordinary man. His leadership and his personal life have both been role models for us fellow Singaporeans. I look up to him, and only have respect for him. Singapore has lost a great leader. He has not only impacted Singapore, he has impacted the world. Let us not lose his vision for Singapore. Thank you Mr Lee Kuan Yew, for everything you’ve done for Singapore.
Carissa Lim

Dear Mr Lee: Thank you so much. I am the daughter of a single mother.


She certainly could not afford to send me and my two other siblings to school.

We had free education throughout our lives and I managed to complete my education at the University of Singapore.

Now I am retired and have my own HDB flat and pension.

Rest in peace

前人种树，后人乘凉,
没有李光耀,就没有今天的新加坡。
谢谢您为新加坡所做的一切。
巨人心中一把非常炽热的火，不是怒火、妒火，

而是为人民为社稷努力贡献、服务的热心，
在您的心脏停止跳动时熄灭了。。。
但就在这一刻，
这个火苗顿时点燃了数十、数百万人的，像传火炬一样，
这份炽热的得以传承，继续燃烧！
我们个人的力量也许微不足道，像根小蜡烛的烛火，
但是如果大家能够各尽绵力，一起燃烧，
必定也能像那把巨大的火炬一样，光辉灿烂！
人们常说，时间会冲淡一切，
真希望您的这份心思能一代传一代，一直延续下去。

永别了，国父。

To Mr. Lee Hsien Loong and his family:
I send my deepest condolences. To my fellow Singaporeans: we are united this week while we grieve for Mr. Lee Kwan Yew, our founding father and I stand with you.
I am a 29 year-old Singaporean happy married and now living in California, USA. My husband is American and together we have a 4 year-old boy.
Growing up in Singapore most of my life, I have fond memories attending PCF kindergarten run under PAP, and then Bedok South Primary School (now Bedok Green Primary). Until my secondary education, my schools were never further than a 10-minutes walk. I also took various swimming lessons offered by the school, and of course the Bedok Swimming Complex was less than 10 minutes away. My grandparents lived only 2 minutes away, in between my walk to school, so often, my late grandfather would meet and walk with me to school. When my bag pack felt heavy, he would offer to carry it for me. After school, I would frequently have lunch with my grandparents (my grandmother made the best porridge and my late grandfather the best milo) who would take every opportunity to tell me about about the unimaginable hardship they only less than 2 decades ago had to endure: my grandfather worked at a bakery kneading bread as early as 3am every morning and my grandmother picked up dirty laundry to wash by hand – all the while supporting 5 children. My mother would occasionally echo that she had to trek more than an hour and a half each way to school, with a daily pocket allowance of only 10 cents – which would essentially only buy a cracker or a snow cone so most days she would simply save up and choose not to eat. I had a daily allowance of 50 cents throughout primary school, which wasn’t much compared to some of my peers – but it was plenty to get me a square meal during recess – albeit with some ingenuity at times. I remember actually wondering at times during my primary school days, why my grandparents and parents led such different lives from mine but of course it’s not only until I was older that I truly understood the reason.
My sister introduced me to some wonderful books when I was 8 years old, and not long after my favorite thing to do was to visit the Bedok Library every weekend. When it felt like the Bedok Library’s collection wasn’t big enough to satiate my appetite for more variety of books, the Marine Parade Library (only a easy bus-ride away) became my favorite go-to. If I saved up enough of my allowance that month, I was fortunate enough to also spend it on a brand new book I would pick out with pride at Parkway Parade Mall’s bookstore – which was only again an easy busy-ride away from my home or either libraries. When the new Borders – and later Kinokuniya opened near Orchard Road area – I flocked there. No surprise that with SMRT, it wasn’t even close to being any sort of a trek my mother had to endure going to school all those years ago. Additionally, when the new EZ-Link cards were introduced I no longer had to ever worry about being caught without cash in my wallet: the DBS savings account I was encouraged/incentivized to open through a program in primary school ensured that I always had a way to auto-deduct my EZ-Link card renewals to pay for all the fares I was raking up. Local banks like DBS flourished under Lee Kwan Yew’s encouragement and guidance.
Shortly after arriving in the US to attend college, I realized how well-rounded my education in Singapore had been – which prepared me not only for success in school through a very different system but also success when I entered the workforce. Although I was never the best writer in class or at work later – I was always able to communicate well and effectively. Although I was never strong in math or sciences throughout school, I had a wonderfully strong foundation that helped me tackle the analytical and statistical components of all of my jobs. The multi-racial and cultural exposure in Singapore has also served me incredibly well overseas – I was able to hold conversations well with business partners, colleagues and strangers who hail from all over the world, many a times in fact recounting countless of facts about Singapore’s demographic and geographical facts, and detailing its infrastructural and economic prowess. People would of course inadvertently ask about the bans and fines Singapore is well known for, but I always enjoyed dispelling the myths and cliches behind them. Today I hold an excellent position in a tech company in Pasadena, California – and not a single day passes when I fail to remind myself and my family that I was simply only fortunate enough to have been the recipient of all of benefits of Lee Kwan Yew’s leadership: Everything I have named in this tribute, from the convenience of attending schools (and for my parents they are grateful for its affordability), countless after-school programs, emphasis on the English language as a first language and Math and Sciences to enjoying world-class standards in our library and transportation systems which only boosted my love for reading because it was so easy to access. I greatly benefited living close to my grandparents – who were everyday filled with pride they owned their very own 2-bedroom flat made possible though the HDB project.
Even though I live overseas now, I will never forget Mr. Lee Kwan Yew’s foresight and vision that makes Singapore not only my forever home but the reason I am humbled, well educated and thriving.
Thank you Mr. Lee Kwan Yew, we are forever in your debt. You have done so well, sir.
Sincerely,
Yen Hong

I’m writing on behalf of my 68 years old mum. She would like to say thanks to you Mr Lee for bringing Singapore through a period of turmoil and chaos. In her memory, you were the guiding light, the star amongst the darkness. Through her recollections,I grew to admire you, respect you. In life you guide us, in death you unite us. Thank you Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
Lennon Koh

Dear Mr Lee, I am often approached by my overseas colleagues to work with them in their home countries. My reply is always No. Why? My answer is I couldn’t find any place safer than my own home country, Singapore and the cleanliness and good infrastructure where I could find comfort.
Thank you very much for everything.
You are always in my heart. Always.
Love,
Judy

We started from a marsh land with no natural resources. Some say we are outcast, but you insisted and proved that we are not. The ways you lead us, not only put Singapore onto an international stage, but to an exceptional level on the international stage.
I was in Penghu Taiwan when you had suddenly left. The news travelled far and wide. Without fail, from Penghu to Taipei everyone I came across asked about Mr LEE KUAN YEW.
Tears began to roll when a Taiwanese lady working in the hotel’s VIP Reception told me her story of how Mr LEE KUAN YEW had helped Taiwan in the 1980s and thereafter they did not have to flee their homeland.
They all asked how will I describe Mr. LEE KUAN YEW. These were my exact descriptions: Mr LEE was an exceptional Singapore Statesman. He was a Salesman who sold the Singapore brand throughout the world, he enticed numerous investments from overseas into Singapore. He is stern but yet had a caring heart. He is my perfect role model as he built Singapore from absolutely nothing to First World Country.
Mr LEE used to ask when on board flights. “Where did this water come from?”
Mrs LEE will be telling him.
“Harry, don’t disturb the crews”
Mr. Lee, the water came from your relentless work and your lifetime of commitment. We must be independent from the first source we had and you saw that too. We must be independent from the water source and have our own water source.
Thank you for committing your whole life and strength to us.

I’m so grateful for my life in Singapore. My maternal grandma was a first generation Singaporean and a child bride. She was fortunate to have completed her secondary school in Nanyang Girls School and she taught there till retirement after graduation. My mother had even better opportunity. She completed her education at the University of Singapore and went on to further her education in the US on an Asian Plan scholarship. Today, a woman completing her university education is the norm. These opportunities for women would not have been possible without your leadership and foresight.


I’m so proud to be a Singaporean. Even in death, you unite us as one people.

谢谢您一身为国的贡献。感恩。

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
You are truly the founding father of Singapore. If it’s not because of your vision, courage & determination to transform Singapore (then an island nation), Singapore would be still a third- world country, not a first-world country in less than 50 years.

It is because of your leadership, your team has built the infrastructure of Singapore … including military, police force, transportation, education, etc. Most importantly, to ensure Singaporeans have their own homes, pay their medical expenses and have a good retirement, all Singaporeans are required to save part of their salaries into CPF. You’ve always cared for the future of the nation … be it for our pioneer generation, low & middle-income families, disabled, SMEs, etc, to ensure everybody are not forgotten.

Thanks to you and your team for bringing Singapore to the world’s stage (e.g. Changi Airport, NUS and NTU, etc) especially when there are no natural resources in Singapore except human capital. All these efforts brought investments to Singapore to create jobs as well as to allow Singaporeans to learn new technologies from around the world.

We are indeed proud to be Singaporeans to stay in a safe, clean & green environment and where the government acts fast on issues (e.g. SARS, global economic crisis). And not forgetting our Ministers and MPs spending nights (after office hours) working on the ground to help Singaporeans in need through MP sessions.

Singaporeans will definitely continue to stand and unite as One People, One Nation. And I am sure all Singaporeans will definitely carry on your vision and determination for our future generations.

Thank you once again for your lifelong contribution to Singapore … Singapore would not have make it without you. We’ll definitely miss you and we’ll always remember you. Please rest in peace.

A Good Man by James Whitcomb Riley
I
A good man never dies–
In worthy deed and prayer
And helpful hands, and honest eyes,
If smiles or tears be there:
Who lives for you and me–
Lives for the world he tries
To help–he lives eternally.
A good man never dies.


II
Who lives to bravely take
His share of toil and stress,
And, for his weaker fellows’ sake,
Makes every burden less,–
He may, at last, seem worn–
Lie fallen–hands and eyes
Folded–yet, though we mourn and mourn,
A good man never dies.

Thank you Mr. Lee Kuan Yew for your worldly foresight and your belief in this country.
May you rest in peace.

A visionary leader, a resilient fighter but above all, a loyal patriot. Improving lives of Singaporeans was your one and only goal in life. It is Singapore’s and Singaporeans’ good fortune that you had safeguarded us for so long. No one can ever come close to what you have done for us. We had so little till you gave us so much. No amount of words can ever express our gratitude.
But you taught us beyond leadership and visioning but also about steadfast love and commitment. Your love for Mrs Lee taught us the meaning of a vow- that a promise is a promise, whether in good times or bad, in health or in sickness, for better or for worse….. You had similarly showed your love for Singapore and Singaporeans in the same way.
You may be comforted to know that your passing on has again brought about another miracle. Singaporeans are coming together as one people again to truly reflect our national pledge – “We, the citizens of Singapore, pledge ourselves as one united people, regardless of race, language or religion..”, except that this time round we are united not so much to achieve ‘happiness, prosperity or progress’ but we are united for an even more powerful reason – Singaporeans’ endearing love and utmost respect for you.
You are our legend. Your passing on is an indescribable loss for us but you have toiled a lifetime for our well-being. It is now time to rest. May you reunite with Mrs Lee and rest in peace. You will always be in our hearts and never be forgotten. What you have done for us and taught us will always be etched in our hearts deeply… Your enduring legacy will continue. We will press on and fulfil your wish to see this red dot stay bright forever – 红点将永远为您光耀着!
” Look at that horizon, follow that rainbow, go ride it.”

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
You are the architect of this modern, first world metropolis.


You built a cohesive, multi-racial nation.

You created the foundation for tripartism of government, employers and unions to foster strong tripartite relations underpinned by mutual trust and respect.

You established the Industrial Arbitration Court for the peaceful and just resolution of trade disputes.

We, the citizens of Singapore, salute you.

What you have done for us, as a people, will always live in our memory.

Today with much sadness, we bid you, our beloved founding father, farewell, and may you rest in peace.

Justice Chan Seng Onn, President Industrial Arbitration Court

我的母亲非常敬佩国父李光耀先生。她在去年12月31日去世，享年78岁。我谨此为她代笔。我的父亲现已86岁。他也要我在此帮他致意。


母亲吴惠兰女士因家境贫困无法受教育，十一二岁就得做散工养家糊口。她经常告诉我们因为有李光耀先生我们才有这些好生活，要我们好好读书。

我爸爸陈金昭先生只受过小三教育就得辍学卖菜养家。但是，在李光耀先生为民为国的政府带领之下，令我的双亲感到骄傲和感激的是我们六个孩子都能完成大专教育。

爸爸在1998年患大肠癌、2000年及2003年复发。多亏陈篤生医院的出色医生和护士使我的父亲一一克服癌症。不论背景，我们都得到同等的优秀医生治疗。

敬爱的国父，我们由衷感激您！我们深深怀念您！
请您放心！不要为新加坡担心！
希望您一路好走！

李显龙总理，请保重！希望李总理与家人都节哀。

Dear Sir, Mr Lee,
Thank you for giving us an identity and writing a history for us that we are all so proud.


Watching over us from above, I believe it is a comforting view from wherever you are, how united as One everyone has shown in Singapore. It is through this grieving times that I am ever more proud that Singaporeans are setting aside their differences and working together to support one another at the Padang.

You have done so much. You have done enough, now let us show you how we, as your fruit of labour, can and will build on the enduring legacy you have left behind.

May you rest in peace and enjoy a loving time having re-united with Madam Kwa by now.

Singapore Loves and Misses You!
Edmund Lim

Looking back at Mr Lee’s speeches I really appreciate his openness and efforts to engage citizens and explain the rationale of the many tough decisions and policies that had to be implemented and why it would benefit the country and future generations. The bigger picture and future generations was at the heart of his decisions. Through the stories and anecdotes told, I highly admire his personal values of pragmatism,frugality, meritocracy, resilience, integrity. He was a visionary leader, a tough leader with strong convictions, a believer of continuous improvements and a leader who cared about the people . Thank you Mr Lee for building the foundation for what Singapore has become today – a place we call home. I am proud to be Singaporean. I hope that our current generation of leaders and future leaders and Singaporeans continue to embrace and demonstrate the core values that have built this country.

We are deeply saddened by the death of a great Asian Leader – LEE KUAN YEW – who had contributed immensely to East Asia’s adult education through his policies and passions for lifelong learning.

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
You will heartened to know that you’ve built a nation with gracious Singaporeans, all coming together regardless of race, language or religion over the past week to pay our final respects to our Founding Father of Singapore. We share a profound heartfelt pain and loss for a common moment in history we will never forget. Yet amidst our grief, kind gestures spontaneously sprout across the nation among the people you’ve nurtured with your caring heart.


We sometimes wonder what Singapore stands for and if we ever have a Singapore icon. Is it the Merlion? Vanda Miss Joaquim? The Esplanade? The Singapore Flyer? The Parliament House? We never get to agree with a common identity, but Singaporeans and people from all over the world can easily identify with Mr Lee Kuan Yew as Singapore. A living icon and sense of common identity among all of us indeed.

I’m really thankful to live and grow up here in a safe and secure Singapore – our homeland where we truly belong and are so proud of. Thank you Mr Lee for your immense dedication and devotion of your entire life for all of us here in Singapore. Your lifetime contributions and efforts in building this nation will always be etched deeply in our hearts and minds. Thank you very much for crafting a wonderful Singapore Story for us. We will carry on co-creating our Singapore Story as one united nation from here.

Rest in Peace and have a good restful journey with your beloved wife.

Dear PM-SM-MM-Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
I truly thank God for blessing us with such a sincere, deeply committed, wise and caring leader in you.

I had always been deeply awed and impressed by your powerful, persuasive and passionate National Day rally speeches even when I was just a young boy and teenager in the 80s, and was spellbound and glued to the TV listening to you.

Like many young and impressionable teenagers, I had my fair share of grouses and criticisms against certain tough aspects of your government, even though I liked you and believed in you.

But as I grew up into adulthood, became a father myself, and read your memoirs, as well as other articles written about you by your family members, your colleagues and citizens whose lives you have directly touched, and listened intently to your interviews and speeches on You-Tube, I gained a whole new insight into your being and what you stood for, both in your public persona and private life.

You are indeed a man who walks the talk, and who conducts himself consistently and with integrity, both at home and in public. The testimonies by those around you of how you cared for your family, colleagues and close ones, consistently with how you governed our country, have elevated my respect of and trust in you to a whole new dimension. Your heart, mind, and body are truly one and congruent with each other.

As a father myself now, I also fully understand and appreciate your love and constant concern for the well being of not just the fellow country men of your generation, but also the future generations of Singaporeans. This is a source of much comfort and assurance to me, knowing that because of the solid foundations and institutions that you have set in place, my young son, whom I love and care for deeply, can look forward to an equally wonderful home in Singapore in the future, despite the increasing challenges of a more complex, competitive and globalized world we live in today.

I say with a deep sense of gratitude and appreciation, and from the bottom of my heart – thank you, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. I salute you!

God bless you.
Edwin Mah

Dear Mr Lee,
I may not have met you in my entire 24 years of existence, nor fancied myself to be particularly a patriotic Singaporean, but your passing on had me shedding unknowing tears of sadness and grief every time I read about you. It felt as though I had lost a grandfather that I never knew of and I am only discovering these memories after you had passed on.


During this week of national mourning, I was deeply moved to read all the news of the many people from all walks of life and ages, coming together with a single motivation as they toll many hours waiting for that moment to pay their last respects to you. I was even more touched at the many acts of kindness, patience and the rarely seen community spirit displayed amongst the people. On social media, your tributes have poured in endlessly from instagram to facebook and twitter. We are standing united because of you. There was no “”ugly”” Singaporean in sight as we show our true colours in this time of mourning. We may complain a lot on a daily basis, but I believe all Singaporeans possess such gracious morals, etiquette, respect, love and compassion that has been indirectly instilled in us because of what you have done for our country. You had been a wonderful role model to all of us. This week had been the most remarkable and impactful week I have witnessed Singapore so united as a nation ever since I was born.

Thank you for dedicating your life to building this island nation which has been my home since birth. I come from a generation who did not suffer but benefited from your vision and hard work. Without you, there will be no Singapore like today. There are no words that can express my utmost gratitude and respect I have for you. Your avid love and unfaltering dedication to your late wife has captured my heart. Like many others, I have only came to this realisation of how you have indirectly contributed so much to a part of my life, only after your passing.

Singapore has always been synonymous with your name, your legacy will live on in the memories and hearts of everyone of us. Thank you for making me proud to call myself a Singaporean. You truly are our nation’s pride and glory.

Rest in peace.
Liau Kaixin

Being a child of the 60s, i benefitted from Mr Lee’s hard Knox grit and determination to make this little island a force to be reckoned with. He set the scene, paved our way to greatness and armed the people to succeed. Singapore is (and will always be) synonymous with LKY. I’ve had the opportunity to live in Europe and the USA for the better part of a decade and have stood proud as a Singaporean wherever I’ve lived.


Mr Lee stands as a giant amongst men ! A Titan ! Thank you for your sacrifices and indomitable spirit ! Critics will always sprout antagonism and vitriol, but your testament is everything good that Singapore stands for and has achieved.

I am eternally grateful for your foresight and resolve, which allowed me to stand tall and an equal amongst my peers in foreign lands.

Your are sorely missed. Eternal rest Eternal rest grant unto you, O Lord and let perpetual light shine upon you. May you rest in peace. Amen.
Elizabeth Seah

Dear Mr Lee,
We in SG are indeed truly blessed to have you as our leader; one that others the world over envy and only wished they too could have.


You have led with far-sighted vision, unconventional wisdom, uncompromising integrity, unshakable commitment and dedication, a relentless pursuit of excellence, and ever so selflessly to transform SG into a modern metropolis in one generation that’s truly first class by most all measures. For this we’ll never be able to thank you enough!

I particularly admire not only your vision but also your attitude, courage, and tenacity. A sense of purpose … truly understanding the issues, then doing whatever it takes to succeed.

In my younger working life I had the rare opportunity to visit your office at the Istana to deliver a ‘loaner’ unit of the first portable computer for your overseas trip. I witnessed first hand a spacious, extremely neat and organized office. One that was spartanly furnished with old basic functional pieces probably from the 50’s. I couldn’t believe that was the office of the most powerful man in SG! Your frugality truly sets you apart from all leaders of your era, and I believe probably all after you as well. That revelation convinced me beyond the slightest doubt that you came to this high office with the singular purpose to selflessly serve the common good of the people of SG. You are truly one of a kind … I salute you!

You have given up your entire life to build this country. The only way to remember and honour you is to further build on your legacy . . . we will and we must.

Thank you again . . . and farewell, Mr Lee!
Kevin Lai

Dear Mr. Lee,
Thank you for everything you have done for Singapore.


My grandparents and parents started life in a kampong that had no modern amenities or proper sanitation. Life was a hand-to-mouth existence and their future was bleak, doomed to be stuck in the poverty trap. Today, they live in a modern apartment and have access to world class health care and other modern amenities that vastly improved their quality of life. This is a testament of the contributions you have made to improve the welfare of all Singaporeans. You have made it possible for me to be educated and be given an equal opportunity to achieve success despite of my family’s humble beginnings, for that, I shall be eternally grateful.

The city of Singapore shall forever be a monument to you and other pioneers. The gratitude of every home in our island goes out to you and the old guard. Never in the field of nation building was so much owed by so many to so few.

May you rest in peace Sir, for the Singapore Spirit will live on.
Majulah Singapura.
Jen Low

Dear Mr Lee,
Thank you for all that you have done for Singapore especially with the challenges and struggles that you and your team had to face and overcome in the early years of our independence.

I feel fortunate to be a Singaporean, to have had the chance to go to the best schools, to have equal opportunities at work and to be able to walk on the streets late at night and not fear for my safety. In the past one week, I have learnt even more about your dealings with foreign leaders and your stature amongst them. It makes me proud to be a Singaporean, that even though we are a small country, we enjoy immense international clout because of you.

I cannot hope to emulate even a fraction of what you have done for Singapore. But in my own little way, I hope to be able to contribute to the continued growth of our country. May we live up to your legacy.

May you rest in peace.

Respectfully yours,
Lay Keng

Dearest Mr Lee
It took me awhile to come to terms with your passing. But when it hit me, I never thought I would feel so broken. I think I speak for many (if not all) Singaporeans overseas now when I say that our hearts ache even more not being able to be physically present to pay our respects. Though away from home, the Singaporean diaspora stands united with everyone back at home as we show our appreciation and bid you farewell on your final journey.


I am sure no one loves Singapore as much as you did. And for that, I am eternally grateful. Thank you for all the sacrifices you made for us, for laying a strong solid foundation for us, for all the opportunities you’ve directly/indirectly created for us that we so often take for granted, for your service and dedication and for being the greatest leader we could ever ask for. We are forever indebted to you and we can never thank you enough. You are God’s greatest blessing to Singapore and I pray you are in a better place now.

It is with greatest honour that I call myself a Singaporean. You leave behind an invaluable legacy. May you rest in peace knowing that you will always be remembered and we will continue to do you proud.
Judith Ang

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
My family and I would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to you, for the things that you have done for Singapore.
You will always be remembered as the founding father of modern Singapore.


Since young, I have been told great stories about you by my father. You were his hero. I started to read more about you, and follow your speeches. And, unsurprisingly, I began to idolize you as well. I used to tell my classmates that I like you so much that it felt like you were my Ah Gong ( grandfather).

There are so many traits that you possessed. The ones that stood out for me are the love that you have for us, Singaporeans, and the love you have for your wife. You have given your whole life to make Singapore what it is today, and I am grateful to be part of my generation who is able to witness these good things that you have done for us.

My kids are too young to understand the significance of your contribution to modern Singapore, now. When they grow older, I will tell them all these great stories about you, just like how my father used to when I was a child. And I promise you that I will do my all to nurture my kids, so that they can contribute to the growth and well being of this country in future. Singapore is our home forever!

Thank you once again, Mr Lee. May you rest in peace. You will always be in my heart.

With love,
Teoh Kian Cheow

I remembered 15 years ago, at an interview for admission into NUS University Scholars’ Programme, I was asked who is the one person that I respect most in my life. Without hesitation, I had answered Lee Kuan Yew. Even at that tender age of 18, I could appreciate what he has done for modern Singapore.


Coming from a middle income family, I was never left wanting for more. My dad had the opportunity to study and put himself through polytechnic even though he and his siblings were living in poverty. He eventually started his own business and our lives have been more than comfortable. All these wouldn’t have been possible if it wasn’t for the meritocratic society, regardless of race, religion or creed, that Mr Lee had tirelessly championed for.

Beyond that, I’m thankful for being able to live in one of the safest countries in the world with some of the best public housing schemes around. I’m thankful for the opportunities that our world class education has afforded me and the international exposure I have received from being able to travel so freely all over the world.

There are so many more things that I’m thankful for. Things that were a result of the vision of Mr Lee. Things that others have already said in the past week in their tributes. I guess it’s pointless to repeat again especially since talk is cheap. The best gesture I can think of to convey my heartfelt thanks is to try and carry on your good work. I will strive to be a good citizen that can contribute positively to singapore, economically and socially. And I’ll also make sure that my newborn son will learn Singapore’s modern history and never forget his roots.

RIP Mr Lee.
Corrina Tan

Dear Sir,
when I’m typing these words here, I’m filled with regrets for not having expressing them earlier when you were still around. As long as any one of us is born and raised in this homeland, we are all beneficiaries of your hard work and wisdom you have put into building this nation. I’m filled with gratitude to you because I don’t have to grow up during times of political instability or social unrest. I don’t have to grow up in a place where I could not even sleep soundly at night. I don’t have to grow up in a place where I have to worry whether I could have a future.


The best gift you have given to every child in this country is a chance for an education, a platform to excel, and a hope for the future. I used to complain how studying in Singapore was so competitive, so tough. But because of this opportunity to study, I could dream about my future, I could pursue my ambitions, I could earn my own keeping, I could give money to parents, I could treat my mum with my hard-earned money. Thank you for giving me and every child in Singapore this hope and a future we can look forward to.

Prior to studying in the university, I worked in the statutory board for 2 years plus. Speaking from the bottom of my heart, I feel very proud to be a public servant. I feel so honoured to have been part of the public service where you built the water legacy which will stay in my heart forever. Though I was just a support officer, I felt like I have served the nation in my own little effort. It was only after I joined the public service that I realised how much efforts have been put into building Singapore’s four national taps, how much glory Singapore’s water story has brought to the international stage, how much manpower is being put into sustaining and maintaining our water supply now. The amount of hard work is immeasurable. It was only being a public servant that I witnessed all the efforts public servants put in to ensure that every Singaporean has a clean water supply. We take pride in our work and I hope every Singapore also takes pride in the public service and the work you have built from scratch for us. Building and sustaining Singapore was never easy and will never be easy.

What I have learned from you is the strong will you possess and that nothing is ever impossible if you have a strong mind and will to commit yourself to making the impossible possible. From you, I learned a deeper meaning of 饮水思源. I’m born and raised in Singapore. I’m a very fortunate child to have grown up in a stable and peaceful island where I don’t have to worry about tomorrow. Singapore is a country where we can have a future as long as we work hard.

Please accept my greatest respect and gratitude to you Sir!

The past few days have been a very difficult time for our Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, his family & friends, the Nation “”Singapore”” and us “”Singaporeans””. We are deeply grieved that our Founding Father Mr Lee Kuan Yew has left us.


The late Mr Lee had fought for “”Singapore”” survival in the early days of modern Singapore. He had transformed a small unnoticeable island on the world map into a wonderful modern Singapore. Today, Singaporeans are proud to be able to stand tall in the world because of the contributions made by him.

Let us recount some of the many legacies left behind by Mr Lee which we will and should never ever forget :-

The moment we wake up, we are in a house called “”Our Home”” be it HDB, apartment/condominium or landed property – His Housing legacy.

The moment we step into our toilet/bathroom, we are blessed with the tap with portable water – His Water legacy.

When we take bus or MRT to move from one place to another in Singapore – His Public Transport and Good Infrastructure legacy.

The garden city and shades of trees along the roads and streets of Singapore to keep ourselves cool – His Greenery legacy.

When our parents and us stay out late at night, we do not have to fear of being mugged – His Law and Order legacy.

Our country is safely secured from external armed threats – His Citizen Armed Forces legacy.

We have good quality, bilingual education because he strongly believed in investing in the youths – His Education legacy.

Singapore is a multi-racial society. The spirit displayed by Singaporeans & Non-Singaporeans said it all. One Singapore, One People, One Nation – Racial Harmony legacy.

His strong diplomatic ties with the other countries had brought stability, prosperity and progress for Singapore – His Progressing Plans paved for the future Singapore.

Without these extraordinary visions of Mr Lee, our parents will not be able to give us a decent home and a decent education. Without a decent education, we will not be able to provide same for our next generation. We are very grateful for all the contributions he has done for our beloved country Singapore.

Thank you Mr Lee and Farewell!

We salute you and will always remember you!

敬佩您的领导和远见，感动您和夫人为之动容的爱情.
‪一路好走.‬

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Founding father of our nation

It is with great sadness and much pain to bid you farewell at this time of the history of Singapore. Every year I looked forward to seeing your presence at our National Day Parade and I wished you could be with us to celebrate our nation’s 50th year of independence. Without your deep devotion, courage and love for Singapore and Singaporeans (This is my country, this is my life, this is my people), we would have no home and no nation. No words can fully describe my deepest gratitude to you and Mrs Lee and your team of founding fathers who worked so hard and sacrificed so much for us to build this nation. The way you took care of the interests of Singapore and all Singaporeans was like a father taking care of his family and dear children. Living in a peaceful, prosperous and progressive country all these 50 years and able to celebrate National Day year after year is not to be taken for granted. We are enjoying the fruit of your leadership and your labour out of your undying love for Singapore and all Singaporeans. Without your dedicated and wise leadership, we would not have arrived thus far. What have you achieved? A successful Singapore. What have you given up? Your life. You have served the nation till the very end. You truly deserve all the respect , honour and love from us. Indeed, you are God’s blessing to us! There will not be another Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Thank you once again for giving to us a safe and secure country to live in. Growing up during the early difficult and turbulent years of Singapore, I could appreciate your style of leadership.

Your way of life had much for us to emulate too – your character and values.

We will miss you dearly and you will forever have a place in our hearts. May you rest in peace.

Ms Chan Lai Chun

Dear Mr Lee,
Since young, I have heard stories of your great leadership from my grandparents. You were highly regarded as their great benefactor. They are the ones who have witnessed the transformation of Singapore from a third world country during the times of social unrest and political instability into an internationally known first world country today.

No words are enough to express our gratitude to all that you’ve done for the country and her people. We have a safe environment to live in. We have water running from our taps at home. We have shelter over our heads. We get to live in a garden city. We have jobs or businesses which enable us to feed our families. We do not have to worry when we are walking outside at night. We have the opportunity to receive world class education, which lay the foundation for the country’s economic success. We have access to world class health care. All these are so valuable to all of us.

Thank you for your love to Singapore, your dedication, your sacrifices and for being such a great leader to our country. We will all be eternally indebted to what you’ve done for all of us. You will live in our hearts forever and we will continue to give our best for our country and do you proud. May you rest in peace. Farewell, Mr Lee!

Respectfully,
Michele

I was on this space for the past 6 days trying to pen a tribute, this was since written and then erased and then re-written and erased over and over again, nothing I write seem fitting enough to pay respect to a person whom I owe everything I enjoy in life today, how do I ever thank him enough and why did I not treasure nor thank him until now that it is too late? This week of reflections and revelations was really overwhelming for many of us, what you have given us cannot be penned out in a few lines. Today is the final day to say our goodbyes, this week of mourning gave us the space and the much needed time to prepare our mental state to come to terms with this lost, you will live forever in my heart, more alive than ever before…


I am forever grateful, I am forever thankful…

Rest In Peace, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew

Your very proud Singaporean
Angeline Koh, 29 March 2015

Dear Mr. Lee Kuan Yew,
Since young, my late grandmothers had always been your great supporters. They held steadfast trust in your leadership and system of government. Generations on, my family members never doubted the intentions of our government – for our people, for our nation, for our future.


Your great sacrifice as our leader and a global statesman sets an exemplary role model for those in politics and for ordinary citizens as well. You have gone to a better place, but your legacy and exceptional work ethics leaves a deep impression. We shall carry this blazing torch whenever we go.

When I was working overseas for a period, I told myself that in the unfortunate event that you passed on, I would return to Singapore to pay my respect. Talking to a fellow colleague a few days ago who had returned to Singapore as well, she understood my sentiment. We were relieved to have returned earlier, to be on this same soil as you took your final journey.

Thank you for all you have done.
For this nation, our people and our future.
You will be greatly missed.
Paul Yap

Dear papa Lee our founding father of Singapore,
I salute you greatly for your focused, steadfast and extra ordinary intelligence that has brought us through a period of darkness into a world of hope and light, not just for us but for our generations to come. And this period of nation building has occupied the most part of your lifetime; you sacrificed yourself for us. How undeserving am I while I have done nothing for the nation. I can only feel your caring, selfless, responsible nature while having to be a strict and excellence-demanding father overseeing not just a couple of people but the whole of Singapore, without which the best of the best in every one of us will not be brought out. How do we say thank you to you? It is hard. Tears rolled down my cheeks every morning when I woke up for the past 6 days. Following the Facebook news about you every half hourly has made me a crybaby. I am so sadden by your demise; no words can describe this feeling.


In case you are not aware, I would like to let you know, you have already instilled strength, courage and boldness in me that comes with your determination and perseverance that is here to stay in my life. Your wit and assertive ways of constructing Singapore and handling world affairs have impacted me greatly.

When the storms come, you’ve already got Singapore built upon formidable rocks; you have laid down significant foundations for Singapore to strive, to attain new heights, victory, success and to maintain our vigilance and be open to changes and the ability to defend our nation. The phenomenon successes in Singapore, only you can create and have created.

Never mind the insensible critics heaved upon Singapore by some minor West on how we should manage our Singapore, for their critics shall fall off our backs like water upon a fish. We are wise enough not to be distracted but to stay focus on your visions and directions in charting Singapore’s destiny.

My life time motivation is to follow in the direction of your visions, your inspirations and your wisdom. When every individual strives to be the best of the best in their life for the betterment of the nation, the combined forces will propel our Singapore further. You will forever be our guiding light and I am assured of one thing; you have polished us well and have prepared us for the future of Singapore. Your efforts throughout the years in building up Singapore from the very minor to the very major aspects in transforming Singapore are visible to all. You cared enough and were selfless throughout in improving our life conditions at all levels.

Because of you papa Lee, Singapore’s best days are still out in front of us. Nothing is over until we say it is. “Never fear”, you have told us so and I will not fear no matter what comes our way. With your warrior spirit in us to stay forever, there is nothing that is impossible because YEW said CAN!

I am here to declare, I am in this together with you in our nation building and I will do my part as a proud and blessed Singaporean. Thank you for sharing yourself with us all these years; through years of darkness and struggles into affirmation and recognition for Singapore on the world map. Who else can achieve, but YEW. Thank you my papa Lee. Rest well.

With loving adoration and grief,
Stella Chan Choong Wan

A Tribute to our Founding Father Mr Lee Kuan Yew
I have cried practically everyday since that fateful morning we heard about your passing. It feels like I have lost a father who is very dear to me.


Now I fully understand your rationale behind developing Marina Barrage, getting us to be bilingual, creating a green and clean environment etc. I am so touched that you have planned everything for Singapore to be successful and empower us with the necessary to compete on the global stage.

You have painstakingly looked into the interest of every aspect of our lives. Giving us a home so that that we can build our family. Encouraging us to get married and have children when you noticed that the figures have dipped. I am one of those who finally got married at 40 and gave birth to a healthy child who has brought us much joy. Born in the 1960s, I have personally witnessed the great transformation of Singapore to what it is today. You have devoted practically every living moment of your life building the nation, always thinking and working on bringing Singapore to greater heights.

It is so heart warming to see people braving the hot sun and rain to queue for as long as 8 hours to pay their last respects to you, people helping to provide snacks and drinks, staff working overnight to keep the trains running, bus drivers working late hours, logistics personnel and those who have been working hard on the ground past few days. Those who were in the queue were behaving graciously without complaining. They said this is nothing compared to you devoting your whole life to give us what we have today. I feel so comforted that so many of us appreciate what you have done and are coming together as a big family to mourn for the loss of our Founding Father. No amount of words can express my heartfelt gratitude to you for all that you have done for us.

Although I am sad to say Goodbye, I feel glad that you are finally reunited with Mrs Lee. May you rest in peace, Mr Lee. My deepest condolences to Prime Minister Lee and his family.

Karen Tan

我会永远记得你对这国家的付出。


您花了一辈子的时间来建立的新加坡。

是一个。。

安稳,
平等,
不分种族,宗教,语言的地方。

在这样的环境下成长的我, 相信只要努力就能成功。不论家境富裕与否, 不论出生。。

是您, 给了我们希望。。

谢谢您。

Dear Mr Lee,
I’m writing this with a heavy heart as I find myself having lived for the best part of my 33 years knowing that almost everything good that I have enjoyed and experienced all this time is intricately linked to the dedicated work you’ve done building this nation and yet I have never had the decency to thank you personally until it is too late for you to read these words. For this, I’m filled with remorse and regrets and it is only right that I write these things to you now in the hope that in the mass of tributes you have received, my heartfelt thanks will not be lost upon you.


I’ve always known you as the strong leader who brought us through the early independent years, as the one who was the mastermind behind many good things we see in Singapore. But the more I got to know you through the tribute stories, the more l feel indebted to you.

I’ve read about your dedication and single – minded devotion to all things Singapore big and small, trivial and significant.
I’ve read about how revered you are all around the world, for being insightful, almost all knowingly sharp about global trends and future dangers, assisting nations beyond Singapore to grow stronger than they thought they could.
I’ve read about your tenacity, incorruptibility and far – sightedness, your charismatic speeches and your unwavering belief that we can make it as a people.

But there is one thing that struck me. How you found time to love your wife by spending quality time with her, how you returned to significant places of your courtship with her years into your marriage. It shows me at the core of your being, you love the people dearest to you and it is out of love for this country that you sacrificed your time with them for us.
Love is at the core of your purposeful, disciplined, dedicated life.

Your deep sense of purpose, coupled with the love you carry for your loved ones and this country, when combined with your other strong qualities, made you a truly remarkable man set apart from the rest as one of the outstanding leaders of your generation. We are truly blessed to have to have you as our leader and founding father.

Thank you for the legacy you’ve left behind. Like many others, I am honoured and privileged to be a Singaporean and call Singapore my home with pride, for a large part, it is because of you. My personal commitment to you is to love my family with all that I am, my heart my soul my strength, and share with my two little ones about what you’ve done for us, so they too will remember you, Mr Lee. Together with them, we will strive to do our part to contribute to the progress, prosperity and stability of this nation so that the next 50 years shall be more glorious than the former. We won’t let you down, Mr Lee. Let our actions speak louder than these words in the coming years.

May you rest in peace, Mr Lee. You will never be forgotten by me and my family.
Lovingly grateful, Low Swee Xiang

After dinner at around 9pm tonight, I decided to take a drive past the Parliament House with my family which comprises of my wife, a son and a daughter.


Even though we had already visited the Parliament House 3 nights ago, I told my children I had to do it one more time because I knew Mr Lee Kuan Yew would be cremated tomorrow and it saddened me greatly.

We could see crowds still lingering around the Padang and Parliament grounds.

As I drove past it, my children asked me if Parliament House was the place he come often. I said yes of course. He is probably the oldest surviving MP that started the place and now leaving the place. And tomorrow, he would be leaving the Parliament House for the LAST time.

Then I decided we should just drive the route that Mr Lee would be taking tomorrow all the way towards the University Cultural Centre. They all agreed.

We passed through Fullerton Hotel, Hong Lim, Shenton Way, Chinatown, SGH, Bukit Merah, CPIB, Queenstown, Singapore Poly and all the way to UCC. And each point, we would share about why these landmarks were significant and how Mr Lee had a hand in it.

While the kids were enjoying the history lesson seated behind, my wife and me were weeping as we followed the entire route for we knew this route would be his final journey tomorrow.

When Monday comes and everyone goes back to work and to school, things will seemed normal again I am sure. But for me, I doubt I will ever forget this day for the rest of my life. It will the first day of life as a Singaporean without Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
CK Kim

Dear Mr Lee,
There were many things you strived for our nation. Amongst those was a strong sense of identity as Singaporeans. Alas at your departure, we have proved as a nation that we Singaporeans are united in our grievances and the pride of the legacy you have left behind.


Now we shall have stories to speak of to our children; that they become true children of character and resilience
Rest assured we shall endeavour to continue your good works.Today, I am proud to be a Singaporean.

What I admired about you most was how you spoke in simple english and never beat about the bush. How your vision has laid the foundation for many generations to come. You may have had your critics but everyone had respect for you.

There will never be another you.

Because of you, I am here today. My values were taught by my father who always used to quote you. Education and bilingualism was what I was taught to be important. Now I speak 4 languages fluently.

Thank you. We have lost a great man, leaving holes in our hearts.

I pray that God sees your sacrifices for the millions of us.

To the Captain of our ship.
Amen.

Dear Mr Lee,
I read in Dr Lee’s article that you had discussed on the topic of death with Mrs Lee. More like the kind of heart to heart talk between couples, with the conclusion that the one who depart first would be better off without having to live in grief over the loss of partner. On another note, have you ever foreseen that your passing would bring about such unprecedented level of attention? Long, snaking queues of hours to pay tributes to you. At one point, I wondered if you were to be aware of this, while appreciating the kind intentions, would you wake up from your long sleep & ask everyone to go back to work or school? Productivity first. Afterall, you entire life was committed to promoting Singapore’s success. Perhaps even till the end, you wouldn’t want your departure to disrupt the momentum of the society.


I went to the community tribute site to pay my last respect to you. But somehow it felt strange to bow to your photo mounted on the stage facade. Only then I realised that it will only feel right if I’m doing so at the Parliament House, with you there.

I had always known you were there. Maybe less appearances in the public over the years but to know that you were around, this itself was assuring enough. Nonetheless, no mortals escape that day. When the news is finally settled, it is still hard to accept. A part of us seems to become void.

Over the week, I have learnt so much more about you through the media. Your principles, values and attitudes are valuable lessons to learn. I believe the best way to honour you is to be a better person in life and give our best in what we are doing.

I’m fortunate to be born as a Singaporean, to enjoy the fruits of your labour. Thank you for undertaking the laborious task in building this nation from scratch. You could have chosen the easier option – any other jobs and they definitely command less time & efforts than this. But you did not. You had passed the age of retirement but you still cared deeply about Singapore’ future to travel extensively to meet world leaders & attend conferences. Your dedication & love for Singapore have taken us so far.

Thank you sir, you have left us a beautiful legacy. You will be remembered & missed by all. May you reunite with Mrs Lee & both be in a better place, rest in peace.

Foong Yi

Dearest Lee Kuan Yew
Lee Kuan Yew is true hero and extraordinary fighter in Singapore. His master of strategy & knowledge is indeed recognised and honoured by the world leaders. It helps to put a tiny island, Singapore on the map to the First World.


Lastly, We, Singaporeans thank you, Lee Kuan Yew so much for protecting, improving & transforming Singapore into the Vibrant Garden City where every families enjoy the green environment. I know it’s not enough saying Thank you. But we never forget LKY’s legacy.

We will miss LKY so much. Hope LKY will meet his beloved wife who she is waiting for him in heaven.

Good bye & Farewell LKY..

Dear Mr Lee,
Your unbridled ambition to transform Singapore is clearly manifested in your unwavering drive to establish an efficient and transparent government. While critics may disapprove of your sometimes hard handed policies, I believe that you always had the interest of Singapore at heart. Your prowess as a statesman remains unrivaled, your patriotism for Singapore remains unmatched, your wisdom and vision — unchallenged. Your contributions and love for the country shall not be in vain, because Singapore and Singaporeans will take your passing in stride. With each passing day, you will serve as the reminder that we are the torchbearers who will determine the future of Singapore.

Thank you for everything.

Yours truly,
Nicholas Tey

I did not went through the period of turmoil but watching the world today still gives me the jitters of what we could have been with poor leadership.


You believed in building good relationships with the rest of the world, and I really appreciates that I’m always welcomed wherever I go. It opened up a world of opportunities for the people.

Everyone have a chance for proper education but not everyone can excel academically. Our society has been most forgiving and I’m glad that we are moving forward by giving due recognition to skills mastery.

Your take on productivity was simple then: “”Productivity means the ability to use man and machine in such a cooperative way that you produce more products per man hour, of a superior quality, than any man can do.”” In today’s context, it has somehow evolved into cutting manpower at all levels, keeping the cost low. It’s funny how Productivity can be achieved both ways. Doing more with less? Or the less do more?

Your demand for efficiency has manifested in the way Singaporean communicates. Singlish is born because it is an efficient form of English. It is the most effective way to communicate regardless of race, language or religion, at least on this tiny island.

Although chewing gum is a lifestyle that we do not have, I appreciates that we are spared the agony of pulling sticky gum from the sole of our shoes.

Thank you, Mr Lee, and the Pioneers, for bringing order to what was once a chaotic island.

Majulah Singapura.
Chua Wee Ser

Although I am on the other end of the world studying and running in America, the news of our founding father’s passing hit me hard. I felt connected in spirit with fellow Singaporeans in this time of grief, including the 1.5 million who queued many hours to pay tribute to Mr Lee Kuan Yew. From what I have heard, hardly anyone complained despite the hours of waiting under the hot sun. Tears streamed down my face as I watched on YouTube Dr Ng Eng Hen’s speech in parliament. I was in awe when New Zealand’s parliament dedicated 11 minutes to acknowledge his wisdom, foresight, and courage especially during in the early years; such is the global reach of our first Prime Minister.


How does all this happen for one man? I believe the answer boils down to character. Yes, his achievements in taking Singapore from swampland to one of the wealthiest nations worldwide, as well as his efforts in making Singapore one of the safest and cleanest places where our children can run free, are outstanding. However, these results are only a reflection of his inner soul: a steadfast leader genuinely looking out for the best interests of a nation, and a loving husband who shall now be reunited with his wife.

Thank you Mr Lee Kuan Yew for giving up your life to serve Singapore. We are so grateful for what Singapore is today and will be tomorrow. Singaporeans are now more united than ever in sorrow, but we must also be united in celebrating your legacy going forward.
Ashley Liew

You dedicated your life to lead Singapore to where it is today and put in place monumental changes which have shaped Singapore for the better.


You built a strong team and found tangible solutions to tackle the complex problems of a young nation. We will not take for granted the roof we have over our heads, the peace and harmony that we share and the beautiful garden city that we can call our home.

You led a frugal life and showed us how to cherish the things that matter. You lived a life enriched with meaning, fueled with passion. Your story also reminds us of how love is beautiful and how couples should support each other, through good times and bad, in sickness and in health.

You showed us what it means to serve and give of oneself. You worked tirelessly and no problem was ever considered too small for your attention. You said that “”no man is an island”” and that Singaporeans need to place their individual interests aside and steer their efforts towards building community and a strong Singapore. Life throws difficult moments our way and challenges us to make important decisions. Thank you for teaching us about courage and tenacity and for stressing the need for clarity in what we do.

Thank you for your vision and for being an inspiration.
We are privileged to have learnt so much from you and we want to let our children know about all that you have done.
We are Singapore because of you.
You are no longer with us but your legacy will live on. Majulah Singapura!

Rest in peace Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

Dear Mr Lee
Thank you for your selfless actions, enormous vision and values. Your actions speak so much and what you have done for our nation, economy, racial harmony, stability, environment and the list goes on. The tears the whole nation cries for the past six days can never be compared to the amount of energy and sweat you had done for us.


My parents have always share with me and my siblings what you had done for the nation. My parents explained why you had to do what you had done. I grow up appreciating trees, clean water supply and sanitary facilities, smooth roads and pavements, HDB flats and so many more. There is nowhere on earth I would rather be.

You are such a giant and yet gentle to reach out to the weak and helpless. I will forever be grateful to you. I can’t do great things. What I can do is to tell my children and hopefully their children what you have done for Singapore, to maintain the racial harmony you have so preciously protected and to do all they can to continue improving themselves so that they can do their part on ensuring the stability of Singapore you have so painstakingly created.

I always love watching you during National Day Parades when you looked at the sky. I also enjoyed listening to your speeches. It may be long speeches but they are by far, the most inspiring ones I’ve heard. I love the occasional humour you injected into your speeches too.

I always trust you and the governing bodies of Singapore. Even though you were no longer PM but it was a relief to know you were always there. I feel so much pain and loss at your departure that I could not celebrate my birthday yesterday. 50yrs ago, you cried for us and 50yrs later, we cry for you.

Finally, I do hope you will be able to find Mrs Lee in heaven. I remember watching an interview you had and Mrs Lee was wiping your forehead during interval. There was so much love and respect that you and Mrs Lee showed for one another. I will never forget the scene when you gave your final kisses for Mrs Lee at her funeral. It was so painful to see you grieve.

To you, our founding father, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, I may not be able to do much but I will do every bit I can to protect the very elements you had fought courageously for us all your life. I will never forget you and what you had done.

May you rest in peace but please watch over us from up there.

Your forever grateful Singaporean signing off.
Sim Hwee Peng

Dearest Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
We have seen many accolades from presidents of various countries to the man in the streets which i do not need ţo list again. Thank you for making Singapore a brilliant city. You have touch us all one way or another. Your vision have enable us to have a home and you have protected Singapore & Singaporeans from adversities, threats & discrimination. You stood toe to toe against the superpower nations who called Singapore a “”just little red dot”” and made Singapore successful. In my 20 years of global travels, your name Mr Lee Kuan Yew has became synonymous with Singapore and i can sense that some of the foreigners i spoke to, are envious that Singapore has such a great leader. Every year, I looked forward to seeing you on national day and listen to you speak during national day rally. You have inspired me to do Singapore proud.


There’s so little Singapore younger generation knew about you but this is enough for many that i have seen queuing with me for hours to pay our final respect to you at the Parliament House. Many young and old are determine to queue under the punishing weather for hours, is prove of your legacy you left on us Singaporeans. I thank you. And now it’s time for us to carry the torch and take this nation to greater heights.

Although I do not have the chance to tell you in person, i like you to know that you are loved and greatly missed. Singapore has lost our most beloved leader and The Soul of the nation. Rip

No words can describe the loss and grief we are experiencing now as a nation – at the passing of one of the greatest, most respected man – not only of the nation, but the world. It was only through the recent readings of the many articles written of Mr Lee Kuan Yew this past week, that made me realize with tears how much he had toiled his whole life for Singapore, even in his old age, just so that we, Singaporeans, can lead a better life. The fact that in his whole life – even till old, he continued working into the wee hours of the morning for our nation’s sake while the whole of Singapore is sleeping; his kind heart, and frugal ways of living, despite his status, really touched me deeply.


Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew, you have touched each and every of our hearts in so many special ways – for all your countless selfless sacrifices; all the sweat, blood, tears and hardships you ever had to go through for this nation; for the hope, pride and future you have given to this nation; for building Singapore to become the clean and green and beautiful country it is today, no amount of ‘thank-you’s is ever enough, but from the bottom of my heart, thank you.

You will live forever in our hearts and memories. Rest in peace, Sir!

安息吧，李光耀
你曾说，你不希望以政治家的身份被人铭记。同知识、道德和精神上的满足相比，尘世的一切荣耀与成功都是转瞬即逝的。


人们终将长久地纪念你， 一个为几百万人创造了最大福祉的伟人，一个深爱妻子的丈夫。

在这个时刻，你终成一个普通的老人，安静地逝去了。所有人终究都将面对死亡。 你曾经自问，如果可以从头再来，你的人生旅程会有所不同吗？我也不禁问自己同样的问题。

你说，人生变幻无穷。前途充满着未知数。选择了一条道路，就必须向前走，不能再回头。你说，重要的是，不应失去对生命的热爱。

在我生命的转折点，我选择来到新加坡。在这里，我和我生命中最重要的人一起相伴，留下人生中最珍贵的记忆。没有你和你的远见， 多少人的人生将会不同。我也可能会是个不同的人，生活在不同的地方。

在将来的某一天， 在一个安静的时刻，我们会重温自己生活的点点滴滴。我们会记得我们是幸运的，在你和你的同辈人创建的这片土地上，工作，生活，照顾老人和子女，孕育希望。

我知道我应该为我现在所拥有的一切感到欣慰。在这最后告别的时刻，我的心充满了敬意和感伤。
Sam Li

Dearest Father of Singapore, Mr Lee Kwan Yew


It is a blessing for Singapore to have a great leader like you, leading us through rough times to become a prosperous country today. Without your great vision, commitment and leadership, we would not become the First world country today.

My family and myself are fortunate as we need not go through the war and the separation from Malaysia where there were so much uncertainty, yet we get to enjoy the fruit of your labor. Every time the plane touches down in Changi Airport when I come back from overseas, I know that I am ‘HOME’.

You brought Singapore together during our independence and even now, when you are gone. Throughout these few days, people queued for hours under the sun and the moon to pay tribute to you. The Nation grieve for your demise. No words or actions can express the appreciation for what you had done for us, Singaporean.

For generations to come, you will be remembered when we look at the garden city, the education that we will receive and the roof over our heads and your legacy.

Every Singaporean will remember 23rd of March 2015. The day you left us. However, though you are gone, your spirit will be carried on.

A big ‘Thank You’ from the bottom of my heart.
Ang Cheng Tee Travis

Dear Sir,
As I queued up on Wednesday to pay you respect, I witnessed silently how many others have come to pay their respects. It dawned upon me that many of us have benefited from what you provided for our country – a meritocratic society where everyone is given an opportunity to succeed regardless of race, language or religion. It is memorable to see thousands queue up to pay you respect and this shows that what you left behind is a legacy and a living testimony that our country is united and we will remain one Singapore.

You are a great leader and the generation that I live in have much to emulate from you. I hope that my generation and the generations after will continue to remember the struggles you had and the peace and security your sacrifice have provided. We will reflect on your speeches and words of wisdom… we will miss you and you will always remain in our memories. Thank you and may you rest in peace. Lionel Chen

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
How are you? With the uncountable blessings worldwide, hope you are resting peacefully with your wishes fulfilled. Overlooking on the thoughts and visits pouring in for you, it is a testament to how great an influence you were to all of us. I miss you.


I look up to your decisiveness, vision and determination among all the other values that you have positively imparted to us. My heartfelt gratitude to your care and concerns to Singapore, we citizens and our future throughout the years. Snippets I can recall of you fondly displays your beautiful passion – the passion towards merger with Malaysia for our survival, the passion to spearhead Singapore to independence, the passion to improve our fertility rates and bilingualism. You treated us like your precious baby, moulding every area – defence, housing, education, job employment, infrastructure into the success we can enjoy now.

Singapore’s well-being was a constant worry in your mind, thus be rest assured, for we will continue the prosperity you strive for!

To me, you were more than our founding father. As I quote: “”Anyone can be a father, but it takes someone special to be a dad.”” I feel like you may even satisfy a greater place than that in my heart. I will remember you, my role model.

With hugs and best wishes,
A thankful Singaporean

I was very astonished when you touched my hand during your visit to Aljunied when I was a little kid. Although that was the first and last personal encounter with you, I can never forget your loving smile and your sharp eyes that looked at me.


I never missed all the broadcast of your speeches and the interviews of you. Your thoughts and knowledge of the nation and the world, your vision and strategy for Singapore and your views of your team, above all, your passion for Singapore, your love for the people, your iron fist captured my heart and mind.

You are man of your word, what you said you would do for Singapore you did it. Singapore has successfully transformed from Third World to First world. Now every Singaporean has good housing environment, equal education opportunities, high quality public healthcare, clean water, beautiful parks and river within city and world renown transport system. Many foreigners admired what we Singaporean have and the benefits that we enjoyed.

Your visionary thoughts and wisdom about the world affairs, your public relationships with the country leaders in the world, has gained us the respect and acceptance of the world. Just look at the ease of travelling with a Singapore passport that is well received all over the world and the number of FTAs that Singapore has.

Personally, I benefited from your education plan for Singapore and your foresight of bilingualism. I have the opportunities working in fortune 50 global companies, leading project teams that span across US, EMEA, China and Singapore. I am very grateful to you for providing an excellent institutional system that I could gain knowledge and ability to work and communicate with cross-cultural teams.

I read your book about you learning Chinese language and watched your active participation in the parliament in your later years. They encourage me that there is nothing too late in life nor too old to do anything. You are my role model – your wisdom and humility, your passion for Singapore, your truthful and faithful leadership, your romantic love for your wife, your caring heart for your children and grandchildren, and your agape love for other people.

I pray generations after generations of Singaporean will inherit the great values that you imparted to us, and people in Singapore continue to be united as One Singapore regardless of parties. “We, the citizens of Singapore, pledge ourselves as one united People, regardless of race, language or religion, to build a democratic society, based on justice and equality so as to achieve happiness, prosperity and progress for our nation”.

Thank you for your thoughts and plans that you have for Singapore and for us, thoughts and plans for our welfare and peace, thoughts and plans to give us all a future and a place we proudly call Home.

Thank you for giving your life to Singapore, tirelessly serve us and not to be served.

Thank you our founding father Lee Kuan Yew. I love you.
Sophia Loh

Lee Kuan Yew, you were a great man and a visionary who single handedly took Singapore from nothing to where it is today. I admire your courage, strong will and tenacity which are core ingredients of a great believer that “”We Can Make It”” despite the odds and unforeseeable.


You had given so much of your life to making Singapore a better place to live and thrive. Singaporeans are very lucky people who get to enjoy all the privileges and luxuries on this small island that you had once toiled laboriously and relentlessly in the strong belief and faith that one day it would bear fruits for its people.

Singaporeans are totally spoilt by the convenience of amenities and facilities in every nook and corner of the garden city. There are underground links to everywhere you want to go without getting wet if it rains – from HDB to shopping centre and from shopping centre to another shopping centre.

You had brought unity and harmony amongst the peoples of Singapore given the multi-cultural and multi-racial make up.

Your memory will live forever. When I think of Singapore, I think of you. I am forever grateful for what you had done without which Singapore will not be what it is today. More importantly, because of you, we are the most educated people due to your great foresight in the investment of its people and brain power.

Thank you, Lee Kuan Yew.
Mary Pek

Mr Lee,
Your selfless, tireless contributions and sacrifices for us shall stay in Singaporean’s hearts and memories forever. You stood out as the inspirational leader, the guiding voice for us to rally us and bring Singapore through our darkest, turbulent moments. Others would have taken the easy way out, but you took the path unchartered, and single-handledly build Singapore from nothing. And today, we are able to enjoy the fruits of your work and policies which you had labored so hard on for many years. It speaks volume of the borderless foresight that helped to bring us where we are today; a safe, prosperous and vibrant city state. Most importantly, you have given all of us an identity which you had set out to do, a place where we are proud to call Home.


The people shall always be indebted to you. Your legacy will echo on for many generations to come, and future generations will always remember you as the founding father of modern Singapore.
Kok Soon

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
From the Independence in 1965, you’ve put in all your heart, mind and soul into Singapore.


You set up the Infrastructure of Singapore, Maintained and Improved it until what it is today.
It has never been easy for anyone to have done what you did for Singapore, with your Vision, Intelligence and Hard Work.
I am proud to be a Singaporean, to have been born in Singapore, witnessing all the changes, through the times where Singapore transformed into a First World Country through your Hard Work, Passion, Commitment and Effort that you’ve put in to make Singapore became what it is today.

All your ideals, speeches, thoughts, histories will be always remembered, deep down into our hearts.

“”If you, who are growing up, do not understand that you have to defend this, then in the end, we will lose. Other people will come, smack you down and take over.””
– Lee Kuan Yew in 1967.

This quote has always been in my mind, I have always agreed that, if we don’t defend our country, who will?

Mr Lee,
Thank you for everything, it has been a long road for you, putting every single effort, mind and strength for Singapore.
There are no words to describe my gratitude for everything you have done for all of us and for Singapore.

Have a good rest, farewell and rest in peace.
Damien Tan Chin Wee

Dear Mr Lee,
Every year National Day, I will look forward to seeing you at the parade as you would make it a point to come rain or shine. You will be greatly missed especially in this year National Day parade as we celebrate the fruit of your labour.


Thank you so much for your sacrificial love for Singapore and all you have done for us. Without your visionary leadership and dedication to Singapore, it will not have progressed so far.

No words can describe our grief and sorrow at your passing. Though we cannot bear the thought that you had finally left us forever, you had done enough for Singapore. You needed a good rest.
May you rest in eternal peace, MM Lee.

You will always be in my thought and heart,

For 50 years you have been working tirelessly to build for us not only a good education, job and a roof but the most clean, safe and beautiful vibrant garden city that many people from other country envy us and would wish to live here too.


All the world know Singapore all because you have made the five star in our country flag shining bright like a diamond round the globe. You have make Singapore from a small red dot in the world map to become a world class country recognize by all.

You have dedicated your entire life to ensure every Singaporean has the best in every aspect including a foundation that will last for many years to come. We appreciate everything you have built for us and its ours now and many more new generation responsible to safe guard Singapore.

With many top official from over the world pouring in here to send you off, its further endorse your position in this globe and making all Singaporean proud. We wish we could have you around for another 50 years as we will miss your sharp vision, convincing speech, at time candid, your laughter and many more memory you have left behind. Father Lee Kuan Yew, We are lucky to have you and without you we may not have what is Singapore today, We thank you for all your determination and unselfishness to dedicate all your life for us and you will be forever remember.

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
The only time I ever saw you in real life, was when the school choir I was in was invited to sing the National Anthem at the Tanjong Pagar CC, to celebrate Singapore’s 42nd birthday. You were seated at the table right in front of us and I remember being so thrilled to be able to sing for you, the Founding Father of Singapore.


You were always more of a textbook figure to many of the youths in my generation. Sadly, we were not able to experience the years when you rallied the older Singaporeans together to build this beautiful nation that we are all proud to call home now.

Admittedly, the first time I’ve heard your speeches were when our local channels started to air them after your passing, but after every single speech I’ve watched, I was in awe. Your passion for Singapore was evident, your desire to build an independent Singapore was strong and you were ever so humorous in your own way.

People say that you ruled Singapore with an iron fist and that too many restrictions have been placed. Yet, I feel you were just doing the job of what a typical Asian parent does. It’s like how our parents placed restrictions on us when we were younger, you probably felt it was necessary to establish these rules during our developing years. Thanks to that, we are now one of the safest and cleanest countries to live in the world.

Over the past week, 1 in 10 Singaporeans have queued for 4-11 hours just to catch a glimpse of you, me included. The wait was tiring but nothing could ever compare to the effort and dedication you put into serving this nation.

Thank you and rest in peace, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. You will definitely be missed by all of us.
Tay”

Dear Mr. Lee Kuan Yew,
On 23rd March 2015, I woke up from sleep at about 0600 hrs in despair when I read the news of your passing at 0318 hrs from the screen of my mobile phone. I disbelief that our founding father has passed away.


Mr. Lee, your contribution for Singapore & all Singaporean are beyond doubts. You have sacrifices your entire life over 6 decade for every single one of us as a Singaporean. We, as the citizens of Singapore, owe you huge debts and probably unable to pay back in our entire life.

I am very sure the new generation leaders of Singapore will continue your great legacy ensuring Singapore future prosperity. Singaporean will definitely continue to work hard and strive for a better future with the new leaders.

My family & I, thank you for bringing us whatever we have in Singapore today.

May you rest in peace & blessed all Singaporean always.

Thank you Mr. Lee for your many years of dedication and perseverance to change Singapore from a third world country to a first world country. You have blessed us with a beautiful, flourishing and stable green city with your many years of labour and vision. Without you, there would be no Singapore and we should never take things for granted.


Fifty years ago, you have cried for the nation and fifty years later, the nation is crying for you. It warmed my heart so much to see many people queuing many hours with no complaints just to pay our last respect to you. This clearly displays our nation united as one! One people, one nation, one Singapore!

Though I am not born in the era whereby I am able to experience the radical changes. I would say, I am extremely bless to be born during the time whereby Singapore has developed so much. Having watched the programmes on TV about you, your contributions, passion for the people have etched in my memory. I will always remember the values you have taught us to my next generation.

I brought my young son whom is four years old to pay our last respect to you. He may not have understood why but I am sure when he grows up, he will be able to relate.

I am still saddened by the fact of your departure, however, the greatest consolation is that, both Mrs. Lee and yourself are finally united.

May you go in peace, Mr. Lee.
Wong Yoon Mei

Dear Founding Father Lee Kuan Yew,
I am sorry for being ignorant about you and taking things around me for granted for the past 30 years of my life. Your passing really wakes me up and makes me having a different view in life. I have always thinking of migrating but I’m having a second thought now. Seeing my daughter having a better life than mine is a proven result from your great leadership. I hope that I will have the chance to contribute to Singapore as I’m a Singaporean. No matter what you’ve done, right or wrong policy, I know you did it for our good. Seeing you off during the state funeral procession under the heavy rain is nothing compared to the dedication you have for us during your lifetime. You will be greatly missed and will be an inspiration to me. Thank you once again for everything that you’ve done for us. May your soul rest in peace.

There have been leaders who fought and freed their nations from the colonial yoke, there have been leaders who led their fledgling nations on the path of peace and development, there have been leaders who united teeming millions into a nation, there have been leaders who reside in the hearts of millions, there have been stalwarts who served the poor and unfortunate, there have been stalwarts who fought to eradicate social evils.


Yet, there has been and most probably will ever be one person who achieved all this and more. A man who dared to fight the imperialists, a man who dared to fight divisive forces, a man who fought back shattered dreams of a lifetime to fight back and forge a nation where none existed. A man who turned adversity into opportunity. A man who dared to take strong decisions in the interests of his country and countrymen. A man who delivered and in style.

A visionary who thought of plans which are strategic and management jargons today. Environment sustainability, core competence, efficiency, productivity, clean and efficient governance, on time delivery, courteous public service. You name it and all these were thought,planned and implemented in the 60s by this visionary. A strategist, a far sighted visionary, steadfast, determined, resolute, a real leader.

Yes, the world may never see another one like you. Our humble salute and a heartfelt thanks for everything you did. May your vision live and may the nation continue to prosper as you envisioned for ever.
Nikhil Namboodiri

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
Thank you for being the driving force of Singapore. Without you, I imagined that Singapore would be a very different country.


Singapore would not have been the great nation it is today if it you did not believe in us. You persevered and spearheaded a small fishing village into a cosmopolitan city. It was, no doubt, a difficult feat. After all, Singapore was just a small country in Asia. We had no natural resources and land was limited. But you had a vision and you saw to the end of it.

Gaining independence, you laid out plans to ensure a good future for your countrymen. You implemented them efficiently and effectively. The truth was that you loved Singapore. Simply, profoundly, and utterly.

Your character and integrity were the most important part of you. You believed that only a man with great morals and values can rule Singapore. You were, perhaps, the best person for the job. I think that everyone ought to emulate you; to be a person of principle and do what is right instead of what is popular.

As Singapore grieve your death, we also celebrate your life’s achievements. You left behind a powerful legacy that will be remembered by each and every Singaporean.

Thank you very much indeed for being the architect of Singapore.
A genuinely grateful citizen of Singapore, Desiree

Dearest Mr Lee
“”Merdeka!”” a word which you often used back in the early years of Singapore. The word that probably kept you motivated throughout the darkest moments of your life but yet got you through it. Risking your life and battling against all odds, you pulled through with your perseverance and determination for our independence. You strived hard for us to build this wonderful nation that i was born into while leading an example of how a great leader and father should be. But most importantly, you reminded me the word ‘independent’. How it takes to be an independent person..


I can’t thank you enough for what you have done. Your contributions and legacy will always be remembered by each and every Singaporeans as well as the future generations. You will always be remembered and rest assured we will live by the fundamentals that you have set for us and together as a properous nation, we build a better future.

One people, one nation, one Singapore!
Love, Flo

Dear Mr Lee,


From third world country with no natural resources to the current prosperous, safe, stable environment that we have today comes by no means an easy feat. But you did it. You believed that in your team, your fellow men and all our forefathers that “”10 years from now, it (Singapore) will be a metropolis – never fear!””

And you said, “”Whoever governs Singapore must have that iron in him. Or give it up. This is not a game of cards. This is your life and mine.””

Thank you for your never ending contribution through your foresight, leadership and grit to what Singapore is today. When I heard of your unwavering love story and then more of your personal life, I was touched. We are fortunate to have everything we have today and are proud to be Singaporeans. Gratitude and appreciation fills us.

You will be deeply missed and will live in all our heart. May you be reunited with your beloved wife and rest in peace.

Thank you ah gong.

Majulah Singapura!
Bennie & Summer

Dear Lee Kuan Yew
I have only met you once. It was on the occassion of tree planting day at my ward BV. Though already feeble in your sagely years, you have nevertheless made it a point to attend the event. I joined throngs of residents in anticipation as we watched you water the new tree. I held much awe of you. I lived much of my childhood under your administration. In that period, I saw then a already modern city metamorphosise into a global metrapolis.


As we approach the final hours of your wake at Parliament house, we continue to mourn the passing of a titan and our northstar. For many of us, this is not only national loss, it is also a personal one. Many
of us stood vigil as we wait for our turn to pay our last respects. In this moment, words become poor instruments in conveying our thoughts. And if we were relive the moments of the 1968 rainy national day, I believe none of us would have move an inch as we await our turn in the queue to stand next to you one last time. No rain, thunder or lightning would have turned us away. Just as in 1968, we would have stayed united.

Even as we mourn, we will also remember to celebrate your life. You have lived your time creating and fulfiling an impossible dream in making this island state our safe home.You have united us as one people in nation building. And we stay united. Your legacies will find its place in the history of nations, and your name will be a legend in our aspirations.

You have lifted this little red dot onto the global map. You have made our 5 stars shine so bright they become the envy and model of nations. You have given us PRIDE. And you do this relentlessly, making it your life mission in pursuing everything possible for the betterment of S’pore and S’poreans.You had expected nothing less for the country and gave your whole life to do this. You do this because for the people, you CARE.

My generation and generations yet to come will remember you. In each of us, a bit of Lee Kuan Yew lives within. We can get to where want to go because of the roads you built earlier. And in doing so, we will continue to build new pathways for future generations. We know you will foreover be watching us.

May you rest in peace.
Goh Wee Hong

It has been a surrealistic feeling for the past five days since you are gone; is it real? How can it be real? It feels that you are still around.


Reality hits home for tomorrow is the day. The preparation of your funeral, the details, the dignitaries; people united to respect you, the world mourns your passing….

So, founding father of the Republic of Singapore Mr Lee, indeed you are no longer with us.

May your spirit lingers forever to watch over us and our leaders.

You have unselfishly given your life to this country till the end. May you now go to another place where you can live a life all for yourself and yourself only. You have said, “”I have no worries, I have done my job””. Indeed your mission is accomplished.

Farewell Mr Lee, good bye.
S. Ngo

Our Wee Family is deeply saddened and grieved with the passing of our Singapore Founding Father – Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Since he was admitted to hospital due to pneumonia, the family had been praying that he would recover well and join the nation in the SG50 jubilee celebration. If only Mr Lee was allowed a few more good months… but nobody defies destiny.


Nevertheless, Mr Lee’s spirit will survive in eternity, in all our hearts and in all our memories, in all aspects and faucets of Singapore, in the history of Singapore and the world as a visionary leader who passionately loves the country, believes in its cause and charts strategies to architect and develop it from a slump to a modern-day first-class nation.

It has been Singapore’s fortune to have Mr Lee. It has been the PAP and the cabinet’s fortune to have Mr Lee as its leader, mentor or coach as there has been so much that Mr Lee has shared and taught. We really hope that the legacy and foundation that Mr Lee has painstakingly left behind, will be the impetus to touch the real passion and hearts of the new generation Singapore leaders to lead with the same type of self-sacrificing heart and brains like Mr Lee had been doing for Singapore and his people, even till the day he was down.

Mr Lee, your destiny with Singapore, with the people and with us, are always bounded as ONE. We fondly bid you goodbye and we hope you be united in happiness with the late Mrs Lee and we hope that your future destiny be of direct relevance to Singapore (if you believe in reincarnation).
Wee Family – Richard, Joyce and Angela

Dear Mr Lee,
I regret that it is only at your passing that I, like many Singaporeans, have a chance to reflect and pay tribute for your contributions to Singapore and more importantly to your citizens in a single minded, emotional yet wholly grateful manner.


I am grateful to have grown up in a Singapore carefully moulded by you and enjoy the fruits of your labour you had toiled so patiently and diligently for us. You have not only put this small and otherwise insignificant country in the map, but also created in your lifetime the ‘Uniquely Singapore Singaporeans’. We may not be conscious but I believe that we all carry a bit of you in our personality as we live by your ethos of hardwork, efficiency (time waits for no one) and tenacity. I am proud of it and thank you for not just the life I lead today (and the future) but also the values you have instilled in me. I only hope to continue to do you proud, as with the rest of Singapore, and my children and the generations to follow, in doing the same.

Your contributions and dedication to this country and your people is irreplaceable and will forever go into the history books as not just the founder of modern Singapore but also our stern yet nurturing Father, always pushing us to be strong and independent but only with our best interest at heart by pushing your children to come together to build a successful and prosperous Singapore. Thank you again and we will miss you.

Christine Chia and family

You have been the most extraordinary and unique world leader and role model. You made Singapore shine on the international level, transforming a little red dot from third world to more than a first world country and number one in many areas that many envy. I always tell my foreign friends and colleague i am not just a chinese, i always insist that i am known as a Singaporean !


We are able to stand proud as Singaporeans, live comfortably in a peaceful and safe country because of your love and dedication, your strength, your leadership, your great vision, an efficient and clean government. I am grateful to be able to experience the transformation (over the 37 years, born, grew up and worked in Singapore) that you have done and eternally thankful to you. My father moved to Singapore from China during the WWII, often tell me stories of the old days. Because of you, i had a good education, bilingual, had a good job, able to improve my family’s life and bought my own HDB flat.

You have touched not just the lives of Singaporeans but also many people around the world. A loving and devoted husband, a strict father, a disciplined man, a passionate man with a strong belief. We will not be able to find such an inspiring person like you. You spent your whole lifetime building this country, you have made sure that your legacy will last for a long time to come. Nothing is by chance.

Thank you Mr Lee. Singapore will forever owes you a debt of eternal gratitude. You made this possible for us ! I am deeply sadden at your departure but happy you will be once again be reunited with Mrs. Lee. You will be deeply missed and dearly cherished in our hearts for forever !
May you rest in peace !

缅怀国父李光耀先生。
黄秀珍 鞠躬

Dear Mr Lee,
I am a member of the younger generation of Singaporeans. Having been born within the last twenty or so years, my peers and I may never truly understand the depths of hardship which our forefathers faced in the past. For us, it can occasionally be difficult to reconcile the imagery of poverty and squalor, violence and rioting and undeveloped swampland with the developed, efficient, clean and comfortable Singapore which we live in today. This is the monumental impact which you have had on my grandparents and parents.

But your work, your life, has undoubtedly been a blessing to my generation as well.

Because you insisted on meritocracy, I and my peers – from all walks of life, from every racial group and from every social background imaginable – were able to learn and enrich ourselves in the Singapore education system, and now have the opportunity to further our studies across a wide variety of fields – from medicine to music; law to architecture; economics to engineering.

Because you stood up against corruption, I as a future doctor can trust that the government’s health policies will be developed for the good of the people and that I will be empowered to help my future patients no matter their social circumstances.

Because you strived to create a clean and green Singapore, I am able to commute from home to university in comfort, to breathe without being driven to bouts of coughing, something which cannot be said about many other great cities of the world such as New York or Beijing.

Mr Lee, because of your unwavering resolve to do right by your people, my generation is one which has a bright future ahead of us. Because of all that you have done for your country, my peers and I have the precious chance to strive for achievement, to enrich our lives and to grasp opportunities that are made available only because we live and were brought up in the Singapore which you have created.

Thank you for all that you have done for Singaporeans young and old, and may we strive to maintain a Singapore that is befitting of your legacy.

May you rest in peace.
Daryl

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
Tomorrow, the whole nation will pay our last respect and goodbye to you. It saddens us greatly that Singapore has lost the greatest leader a nation could have.


Sir, you have dedicated your entire life to building Singapore. You had a foresight that no others have. You are a remarkable man and led your team to ensuring that we, the younger generations would survive and prosper. We survived and Singapore has progressed in such a fast pace that even other developed countries are amazed by our achievements.

‘Merdeka!’ You uttered with such gusto and fervour. And indeed we are ‘merdeka’. It would not have been possible without your sacrifice. We will forever be indebted to you, Sir.

Dear Sir, we will move on but your spirit and memories will live with us. Farewell and Rest in Peace. We will miss you.

To PM Lee and family, our deepest condolences.
Sincerely, Hamidah & Family

Dear Mr. Lee Kuan Yew,
I have never thought of writing to you Sir, but i’ve decided to pen down this tribute for not only of my accord and also on the behalf of my late father.
You were the inspiration to both of us, your selflessness & sacrifices for our people and country go beyond words can describe.


Thank you for the safe and prosperous country you’ve developed this small island from a mud swamp to the metropolitan city we are now.

When I learnt of the demise of you, I felt like I’ve lost my father again, which a part of me died when my dad died. I’m sure many Singaporeans like myself felt the loss of our founding father when you left us, and we’ll always remember you in our hearts and mind.

Your reputation resonates beyond Singapore which is not a surprise to all of us since many people around the world is as saddened as we are and the legacy you leave behind will forever remains in all Singaporeans.

Your passion for SIngapore sits at a testament of all the accomplishments you’ve achieved in building this great nation of ours. I can’t imagine Singapore without you Sir, will we still be a 3rd world country or even a mud swamp?

I am proud to be a Singaporean simply because of this great nation you’ve built from your blood, sweat and sacrifices.

May you rest in eternal peace our great founding father!
Respectfully, Dean.

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
Thank you for sacrificing your life to build Singapore into a Garden City. Without you, there will be no Singapore and no humans like us and Singapore will not be where it is today. Thank you for providing us with a good education. I will be taking my PSLE this year and your passing has certainly created a big impact on me especially in education aspect. Even though you are no longer around, all of us will surely remember all the sacrifices you have made. Singapore is very fortunate to have you as our leader. You are indeed a visionary leader with big dreams and passion and have dedicated your entire life to build this nation. A million thank you for all your life-time hard works and contributions!!!


May You Rest in Peace Mr Lee Kuan Yew. You will always be fondly remembered…
With Love, Isabelle Lim (Class 6J) Maha Bodhi School ”

Dear Mr Lee,
I cannot thank you enough for creating such a beautiful and safe country for me to grow up and now in turn for my daughter to grow up in. This is not to be take granted for. I learnt from my years of travel that it can be considered a luxury for a woman to be able to walk alone on the streets. Indeed The Merdeka you sought & fought for gave me the freedom to walk freely on homeland. Thank you so much for creating this safe & equal country for me to grow and for me to bring up my daughter in. I know my gal will stand equal chances for all opportunities!


The vision you carved out will carry through for many generations to come.
Many of your teachings will always stay in my heart. Towards excellence we will continue to strive. Thank you for giving your life to build our country and improving the lives of Singaporeans. It is never in vain but well worth it.

You will always live in our hearts!

Thank you & goodbye Sir!
Kris, Chan Yan Yi Mother of Kaelyn Teng

Thank you Mr Lee for all your contributions. As a teenager who has grown up in Singapore, it is true that I haven’t been living long enough to have witness the changes and contributions to this lovely country. However, it is this very fact that stands witness to your work and endless efforts; because of the policies you have implemented we are able to enjoy all the amenities the incredibly high standard of living, because of your work we only know Singapore for who she is today, a far cry from the third world country.


As women struggle for equality and basic human rights like education in other countries, I am so blessed to have been born in Singapore whereby education is funded and supported, wholly due to your vision in equipping Singaporeans with knowledge to become skilled, literate and hence competitive. It has done so much to raise generations of thinkers who will continue to drive growth in Singapore. Other amenities like healthcare, a clean and green Singapore and a strong defence force were birthed from your extraordinary vision. Hence, we are so thankful for your contributions, we are so humbled that you have sacrificed your life into building this wonderful home and we are determined to continue your legacy and strive for further success in Singapore.

It has been a long journey and whatever detractors may say, they will never be able to take away the glory that us Singaporeans will endlessly heap upon you, for we all bear witness to the lifetime of achievements you have made for us, with us.

Rest in peace Mr Lee, our founding father, your legacy will continue forever.
Nicolette Koh

You have spent half a century of your life building up this nation. From a tiny island without any natural resources to a first class country that shines out in the world. Your foresight, dedication and great leadership has brought us to where we are today – a beautiful home that is safely secured, cohesively bond together, great education system and a world class business hub. In life, you have inspired us and you deserved our utmost respect and admiration.


I would like to thank you for your great work to lead your team that brought Singapore to what it is today. I am grateful for the law and order, job opportunities, education avenues, clean and green environment, modern infrastructures, convenient transportation system, fresh drinking water and other things that make the life of Singaporean better in many ways. Really grateful that Singapore had a leader like you.
May You Rest in peace. Yours Sincerely, Kaiming & Hui Ping

Dearest Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
Because of you, I am proud to be born a Singaporean.


No words are enough to thank you for everything you have done for Singapore. I am one of the silent majority who have deep respect towards you for your enormous contributions for this country. But today, I have chosen not to be silent.

As a kid, I didn’t know what nation building was about until I saw you delivering your messages during National Day Celebrations and your extremely strong determination to make us a First World City.

Because of you, I grew up with exceptional education, beautiful housing, and world-class healthcare. Because of you, I roam freely in a city with clean air, safe drinking water and low crime rates. Because of you, I had the opportunity to travel around the world, be it for work or leisure, and hold my Red Singapore Passport with a strong sense of pride and dignity.

And because of you, we are now a First World City.

Growing up, I remembered vividly when one of my teachers taught us that you were never ever afraid to take up unpopular policies for Singapore so long as you believed it is for the long-term good of the country. I am indeed blessed to have reaped the benefits of your vision and courage to proceed in what you want for the greater good of Singaporeans.

This week, I cannot help but cry when news of your passing on were confirmed. Though I have never seen you in person, somehow you felt like a close family member to me. Paying you final respects in person at the Parliament House was the very least I can do for you.

Thank you, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Thank you for the tears that you have shed for Singapore. Thank you for putting your heart and soul into Singapore’s growth and future.

And most importantly, thank you for the fatherly love you have shown for Singapore and its people.
With love and respect,
Fang Jee

To our Founding Father, Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
Words cannot express my gratitude as I, along with the entire nation bid our final farewells to you. Under your leadership, Singapore has transformed from a third world country to a first world, modern metropolis in such a short period of time.


Your vision, dedication, sacrifice and lifetime of hard work led to the Singapore today. As a young Singaporean, I have been extremely privileged to be able to watch you lead us from the front over the years. I have been given the same opportunities regardless of my race, religion or beliefs. You have built us a safe, peaceful and beautiful country we all proudly call home.

Rest assure that we will take good care of Singapore and make sure it grows from strength to strength. It is the least we can do to honor your memory and legacy. Your tremendous contributions to Singapore and the world will forever be remembered to future generations of Singapore.

Thank you Mr Lee Kuan Yew for everything. Without you, there won’t be Singapore. I will forever be indebted to you. Rest in Eternal Peace Sir.
A Grateful & Proud Singaporean Son, Leonard Leo

Thank you Mr Lee.
I am proud to be Singaporean because of what you have done.


Thank you for your unwavering devotion, sacrifice and passion towards this country. From an island with almost nothing and many living in poverty, we are a prosperous and peaceful nation today because of you.

I can walk alone at night and have no fear. I never had to go hungry and I have a solid roof over my head. I required extensive medical care from a young age, and my family would never have afforded it if not for the healthcare scheme put in place. I had the opportunity to go to school and that enabled me to hold on to a decent job today. We live in harmony and I am proud that we are one of the least corrupt nations in the world. I am a beneficiary of your tireless passion and devotion to Singapore.

Thank you and thank you again. I can never say enough.

My closest personal encounter with Mr Lee was about 8 years ago when I had to accompany a foreign visitor to the Istana for a dinner function. Our driver drove us past the Istana gates, and then we stopped mid-way. I looked out and saw the back views of Mr Lee and his wife holding hands and taking a stroll. It was such a sweet moment, and it struck me that, despite Mr Lee’s seemingly tough public persona, there was this soft side to him and he was very in love with his wife.

Even as many mourn at the passing of our great founding father, I like to think that perhaps at the other side, you are reunited with your wife and you are happy. Wherever you may be, you will always be fondly remembered and missed greatly by the millions whose lives you have changed for the better.

May we and our future generations never forget what you have done, and continue to build on the Singapore you have created – a peaceful, just, forward-thinking, united and successful nation – that Singapore will always be a lasting legacy to your great works.

Thank you Mr Lee.
Stella Chan

Dearest Mr Lee,
I have always regarded you as a great man and know that you played a crucial role in building the home I have today. But honestly, it is only through the many things I have read and heard over the past few days that made me realize how I have taken so many things for granted.


Thank you for being so strong and persevering in doing what you felt was right for us when our country was so young and vulnerable. It is never easy to go against the flow and I’m almost certain that there were many moments you were criticized, rebuked for your actions. But thank you for believing in us and for not giving up on us. You continued to care for us despite all the difficulties even when letting go seemed to be an easier option. Honestly, I don’t know how you found all the strength you did. You probably didn’t know or expect the number of hearts you have touched until the past week because it probably wouldn’t matter and you would care for us anyway.

Thank you for allowing us to grow and learn in such a safe environment and for giving us the freedom to believe and practise our faith openly. Servant leadership is truly what you practised, leading the nation by serving and placing the needs of all above your own. As a compassionate man, you have showed us how to love and reminded us how we should love the people around us wholeheartedly through all your ‘random acts of kindness’ that perhaps were of second nature to you.

Thank you for all that you have done. For giving us your life. For sharing and teaching us to love and how to love. No doubt, there will never be another person like you.
Celeste

I never realised how good I had it in Singapore until I went overseas to study.

As a child of the 80s, I was born during a time of stability and wealth. I grew up generally happy and healthy, unaware of the many battles that were previously fought over and in Singapore so that we could enjoy what we had.

When I went off to study I had a little bit of a culture shock since there was no censorship, less order in general and I always felt like I had to watch out for my own safety a lot more.

As I grew up, I learned a lot more about Mr. Lee than what was in the textbooks. I heard some inspiring things, and some not so nice things and of course wondered if they were true and if they were, whether they were necessary.

Now that I am where I am – an entrepreneur, a mother to 2 small children, a wife to a wonderful man – I am grateful and will always be indebted to Mr. Lee for the things he has done and for the tough choices he had to make.

As an entrepreneur, Mr. Lee has inspired me with his out-of-the-box thinking. He is an excellent mentor not just for world leaders, but also for entrepreneurs and CEOs who want to build crazy successful businesses and become men and women of substance, integrity and vision.

Rest in peace Mr. Lee. You’ve done so much already; Let us carry on in your stead to bring Singapore to even greater heights in the years to come.
Lise Chew

Dearest Mr Lee,
I have always regarded you as a great man and know that you played a crucial role in building the home I have today. But honestly, it is only through the many things I have read and heard over the past few days that made me realize how I have taken so many things for granted.


Thank you for being so strong and persevering in doing what you felt was right for us when our country was so young and vulnerable. It is never easy to go against the flow and I’m almost certain that there were many moments you were criticized, rebuked for your actions. But thank you for believing in us and for not giving up on us. You continued to care for us despite all the difficulties even when letting go seemed to be an easier option. Honestly, I don’t know how you found all the strength you did. You probably didn’t know or expect the number of hearts you have touched until the past week because it probably wouldn’t matter and you would care for us anyway.

Thank you for allowing us to grow and learn in such a safe environment and for giving us the freedom to believe and practise our faith openly. Servant leadership is truly what you practised, leading the nation by serving and placing the needs of all above your own. As a compassionate man, you have showed us how to love and reminded us how we should love the people around us wholeheartedly through all your ‘random acts of kindness’ that perhaps were of second nature to you.

Thank you for all that you have done. For giving us your life. For sharing and teaching us to love and how to love. No doubt, there will never be another person like you.

A special tribute to Mr Lee Kuan Yew
The founding Father for Singapore


I think everyone not only in Singapore, but the entire region is watching Singapore on this special occassion, a passing of its great leader, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Its a time of thanksgiving and remembering a person whom fight and built Singapore for us. Eventhough I am not a local borned Singaporean, but we are very thankful to him, and his influences us as Malaysian and for me S’pore PR. His deep insight and thougts has brought this land – Singapore to a first class country in this era. His contribution to education and National service is a great impact to us as new generation of Singapore. It is only with high and quality education, produces quality generation and professionals which will brings Singapore to a civilized urban metropolis in Asean and even the global stage of the world.

Mr Lee Kuan Yew has a very deep and brilliant insights even it was many years back to built Singapore differently into a Green and clean garden city. With all these little things, it brings great influences and impact on the country’s economy and opens the doors to multinational trading. Not only that, the houses we stay, the gardens we have, the shelter we walk under the rain and sun, the buses and transportation we have, the fresh air and clean water for us to use, all and all, were fight for and given to us, so we need to be very thankful.

On the other hand, as Malaysian I am very thankful for his great work and open minded to allow us to have a chance to change our life, to be educated, to be able to secure a job and to have a chance to get the Permanent Residentialship in Singapore. All these doesnt comes so easily without him. Without him, we might we suffer together as what most Malaysian are suffering now. If he did not fight for independent of Singapore and think thoroughly and ingenious ingenious thoughts, there wouldn’t such organized and well managed garden living standard and job opportunites not only for Singaporean but also for the citizens of the neighbouring countries.

Looking back at the National Service and educations in Singapore, he created a syllabus of mindful plants to thrive for a healthy, fit and knowledgeable young men and generation. Man in Singapore are physically fit and building a strong mentality to face the reailty and real world through the National Service. Boys are trainned to be stronger and firm to face difficulties and hardship. All these are the long term plans which introduced by our late Mr Lee, although it is a non-popular policy to the nation, but without that we won’t be like this healthy and strong today. On the other hand, his view on the importance of education allows us to be able to be educated even we have financial difficulties or students from other nationality, are given a chance to be educated. Its a tremendous plan and has long term impact on Singapore and those who came to study in Singapore. For me and those whom are given a chance to study in Singapore, we are very thankful to Mr Lee, it is very hard to imagine how are we today if we are not given this chance to enter into Singapore.

There are lots more to talk about when it comes to his hardwork and contribution to not only Singapore, but to the Chinese in Malaysia, and the world. Looking at our region and countries around us, if there is no Singapore, no one will know Malaysia, no one will know us, but because of Mr Lee, we are well-known to the world.

Today, we are his grandsons and granddaughters, here in Singapore and Malaysia enjoys the fruit of his hard work and we are thankful to him. Today also he will meet St John Paul II in heaven enjoy the gift from God for his great work and contribution! Mr Lee Kuan Yew, we love you! and you will be remembered.
Yours faithfully,
Luke Lee.

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
Shakespeare once said, “”Some are born great, some achieve greatness, some have greatness thrust upon them””. Without a doubt, Mr Lee, you were born great, and went on to achieve greatness! You showed the world what a little red dot like us can and has achieved under your great leadership. You were an ingenious visionary!


As residents in the Tanjong Pagar constituency for 3 generations, we had the privilege of having you as our MP. No words can describe our gratitude to you for all the things you have done for us, and for Singapore. A very big THANK YOU to you from the bottom of our hearts.

Time has come for us to bid you farewell. We will always remember you. Rest in peace, Mr Lee, Singapore is in good hands.

PS. Our deepest condolences to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his family on the demise of Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
God bless,

Forever and always, I will always be grateful to Mr Lee Kuan Yew for what he has done for Singapore. It is not easy to have given up his life for Singapore but yet, that was what he did. He gave his all to build up Singapore to where she is today. I am thankful to be a Singaporean, to be living in a clean and green state, to have a shelter over my head, to experience quality education and to have all our basic needs met and more.


In a short span of 50 years, he has achieved so much for Singapore. Singapore is nowhere near how it was 50 years ago. It has grown exponentially into the first world country we are all privileged to live in today. This, I attribute it to Mr Lee, who had the foresight and more importantly, the strong determination to develop Singapore. He never gave up despite the odds. He could have but he did not and all his life, he gave his all to Singapore. It is also inspiring how he never gave up learning even when times were bad and uncertain. He is an amazing and inspirational man and no amount of words can express the gratitude I have for Mr Lee, our founding father. There are times when I wished I had the opportunity to say a simple ‘thank you’ to him when he was living.

The love story between Mr and Mrs Lee has also touched my heart greatly. Their love for one another is like none other. Photos of their younger days actually placed a smile on my face for I am glad that they had each other in their lives. But tears sprung to my eyes when I read about how Mr Lee was dealing with the passing of Mrs Lee. It was an unimaginable period for Mr Lee then. I sincerely hope that they are finally reunited now.

Mr Lee Kuan Yew, you have made an impact in the lives of so many people. Though you are no longer here with us, one thing is for sure, you will never be forgotten. I will always remember you and continue to share your stories with future generations to come. We are here because of you, because you held on and never gave up.

Thank you, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. May you rest in peace now.
Adwyna

Dear Sir
I write this message with a heavy heart mixed with a satisfaction that you have lived a full life.


The world will not see another leader as strong & powerful as you. What you have left behind for us is uncountable. A Corruption free nation, a red passport that requires minimum visas across the world, a country that is safe for a girl to be out at 2am, a very clean & green nation, roof over our heads, ensuring the needies are taken care, etc. the list can go on….. All these are not possible without your guidance & excellent leaders.

We will not despair but will celebrate your legacy. Your leadership will be carried on by your ministers. You are a Good Samaritan & we will be your shadow in this Nation.

I stand proud to be a Singaporean & that is because of you & your sacrifices. We will miss you but you will live in our hearts forever. We will speck your legacy live with the coming generations. It’s now time for you to rest MR. Lee, the giant of the little red dot. You will always be our guardian angel.
Kohila Subramanian

To the family of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
My deepest condolences to the family.


I really Thank God that I am born in Singapore. Thank God that Mr Lee had given his all for Singapore. Without him, Singapore wont be where she is now. We are just a small dot yet we are influential and being recognized internationally for our progression.

I want to thank Mr Lee for building up a clean and green Singapore. Every 20 steps we take there will be trees shading us from the sun. Singapore is also a safe country, I know I am safe even I am out late at night. Mr Lee had also focus so much on education, without knowledge we would be forever a 3rd world country.

Thank you Mr Lee, for what you have sacrifice for the people of Singapore. May you rest in peace.
Michelle Ang

Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s last words to me were: “”Think over it carefully, then you ask me the question the next time we meet.”” (ST, 6 Sep 2011)


But it was not to be. That student forum at NTU marked his last appearance on such a platform.

I will always cherish the little conversation we had. Even though it was somewhat confined within the formalities of a dialogue session, I could feel a personal touch when Mr Lee responded to my question on policies for a more equitable Singapore.

His smile. His chuckle. And gentle jab at the end. Like a stern grandpa.

I have never agreed with his views on welfarism or integration of Malay/Muslims in Singapore. But such differences should not stand in the way of recognising Mr Lee’s undoubtedly special place in the history of our nationhood.

My condolences to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Mdm Ho Ching and the Lee family at this difficult time.
Muhammad Farouq Osman

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
Thank you for all that you have done and accomplished, together with your team, which has resulted in the Singapore that we have all come to love and enjoy.


Nothing brings me pride whenever I have the opportunity to return to Singapore from an overseas trip, and the words “”Welcome Home”” appear at the immigration counter back.

The clean, efficient and safe place that we know as Singapore, which is our home, where we have our roots, family, friends and everything else that we hold dear is a place where the foundations were laid strong.

Without this strong foundation, we would not have the opportunity that we all have today, to build on what has been accomplished. We are also equipped with the necessary skills, together with the wisdom and direction from our past experiences, now able to achieve more for the future of our country.

Thank you for all that you have done, for all your thoughts and decisions which always had the best for all of us in mind.

Rest in peace, Sir, and may you watch over us as we forge the path ahead into the future.
Hong Xianwei

To our founding father, Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


I am deeply grateful for your undying love and dedication to us your children, Singaporeans.

You have given us shelter, education, jobs, security and to be able to have an equal footing in society. To date,no one in my opinion, as done so much for a country, that he had to give up his entire lifetime just to shape a third world fishing village to a world class country.

On your passing, I am reminded of our NDP song truly, which reminisces on your sacrifice for us. This verse of the song reminds me of the struggles and tribulations of your strength.

“”When there are troubles to go through
We’ll find a way to start anew
There is comfort in the knowledge
That home’s about its people too
So we’ll build our dreams together
Just like we’ve done before
Just like the river which brings us life
There’ll always be Singapore””

As sadness overcome us upon your passing I pray that you will rest in peace, do know that we are in good hands. We will keep you alive in our memories.

Thank you for everything, no words can gratify for what you have done. I will continue to teach my children of your legacy.
Sharon Shanti

Dear Mr Lee,
Your conviction and commitment to our nation inspires us to do more for our homeland. Your work speaks louder than our encouragement to those who wish to throw in the towel. You made many people think, “”How can I give us so easily?””, “”How can I better serve Singapore?”” and “”How can we be better Singaporeans?””


Your leadership brought us from nothing to what we have today; from being a rural country with almost no hinterland to a thriving metropolis; from being threatened to having deterrence and letting people know that it will hurt to hit us; from diverse communities to a gelled and orderly community who can proudly call ourselves Singaporeans than by our racial makeup.

Those who refute this are in denial.

Many people, young and old, have learnt or are reminded about things we have taken for granted throughout this week. It is a wake up call to many. Thank you, Sir, for still serving Singapore even after you leave us.

Your demise is our loss. But rest assured that the foundation that you and your team has laid will not be in vain – we will make sure that our country will be much better by the time we leave this world, no matter how small.

This is how we will honour what you and our pioneers have done.

My condolences are with your family. Hope they will be able to tide through this tough times.
Yours sincerely,Alaric Leong

Dear Mr. Lee, our great Founding Father,


THANK YOU, from the bottom of my heart. No amount of words can express my deep gratitude for all that you have done.

I have always grown up proud as a Singaporean. When I was young, I didn’t know why. I just knew I felt proud when I was watching National Day parades, and the crowd cheered when you arrived at the stadium. When I grew up and began to understand more about my country, I begin to understand. Singapore had humble beginnings. We all worked hard, and we thrived under your leadership, your guidance, your determination and many more that I probably can’t name it all. Most of all, I think it’s because of the love you had for our nation and it’s people, that we can now be living in a prosperous, safe and comfortable country, that many others admired.

This week, I found myself sharing with my 3 young children a lot more about Singapore’s history and you and your party’s contributions, and as they found me weeping everyday over the loss of Singapore’s founding father, they began to understand why they are so fortunate to be born and living in Singapore.

What we can do now is to carry on the legacy you left behind, continue to work hard and thrive, ensure Singapore progresses in the international arena, and bring our children up well so they too can continue the legacy, and ensure Singapore continues to shine.

My family and I never fail to watch the National Day parade. This year, we will miss you dearly, and we forever will. But that doesn’t stop us from watching it year on year, as it’s also a time when we reflect and appreciate all that we have. And all that you have done for us.

Thank you, for giving us this beautiful nation. We will continue your work for Singapore.
With lots of love, Eileen Nah and family

Dear Mr Lee,
When I heard about your demise on Monday, tears flowed naturally. The nation has lost its founding father and it is hard to come to terms with it. I watched the the history of how you brought Singapore to independence and to what it is today, I am deeply touched, with admiration for your grit and dedication to this country.


We have learnt much from you, your perseverance and foresight as a country leader; your unwavering love for Mrs Lee as a husband. When Mrs Lee was bedridden, you never failed to read to her each night. When you were hospitalized, you worked tirelessly. Even when you were very sick, you put others above yourself. These are possible because you cared for your people, your loved ones . You have touched the lives of many which can be seen from the endless stream of people coming to say Goodbye to you the last few days. You have inspired and gave hope to the many who think the impossible. Most importantly, you gave us a safe and comfortable place we called home.

Mr Lee, as said, ‘Singapore is your life’s work’ and you know, we Singaporeans can never thank you enough. We will keep your spirit alive and ensure that the generations to come honor your legacy by contributing and making Singapore a better place to live in.

It is time for a well-deserved rest with you loved one, Mr Lee. May you and Mrs Lee be blessed in Heaven.
Alice Goh

Mr Lee Kuan Yew, a man who defied all odds to build a nation we proudly call home today.

I believe words alone are insufficient to truly express the extraordinary feats the man has achieved.

But if one would to just take a glance across the spectacular skyline of Singapore, while reminding himself that this was a third world country not very long ago, he would certainly be struck by the greatness of the man, the man we affectionately address as Father.

This week, the nation and the world mourn the passing of this great man.

Thousands and thousands of people from all walks of life have come together to pay their last respects and express their deepest gratitude towards the man who devoted his whole life to our nation. The endless queue of people outside the Parliament House clearly shows the special, irreplaceable place he has in the hearts of Singaporeans across generations.

As we Singaporeans come together to mourn the loss of our Father, we are truly united as One People, One Nation, One Singapore. As I waited outside the Parliament House, I saw Singaporeans helping one another, volunteers distributing packets of tissue, refreshments and umbrellas. There were also many heart-warming stories shared through social media, and I feel deeply touched by all these little gestures.

I am sure Father would be very pleased.

I hope that this spirit would continue, and we shall stand together stronger and more resolute to continue the legacy of our Father.

“At the end of the day, what have I got? A successful Singapore. What have I given up? My life.”

Thank you, Father.
Kenneth Teoh

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
We are greatly indebted to you for spearheading the transformation of Singapore from the scratch to the current modernised and reputable city in the whole world.


We are gifted to get you as the leader of our young nation. Being the architect of Singapore, you have carefully shaped the country and made it recognised by the whole world. With your visionary instinct, you have worked tirelessly to materialise your visions for the progress of Singapore and for the well being of the people.

We are extremely sad with your parting. Whoever comes to lead our country after your lifetime, no one, absolutely no one can replace you. Nevertheless, the new leaders will definitely follow your footsteps and take Singapore to the next lap.

Your stern leadership with care and concern for the people of Singapore has been admired by all Singaporeans. All the people in Singapore love you deeply. Although you have left us physically, you will always stay in our heart and mind. Thank you very much sir for giving us this wonderful, peaceful, stable and secure life in Singapore.

Sir, please rest in peace.
Tharmilarasan s/o Nagan

Thank you Mr. Lee Kuan Yew for all that you’ve done for this country; for all the sacrifices you’ve made. You’ve made it such that I’m proud to call myself Singaporean anywhere I travel to, proud to display my red passport and proud of defend my own country when ill words are spoken.


Your life work has resulted in people around the world being able to distinguish Singapore from the rest of the region. When asked by others where I’m from, I always respond with pride that “”I’m Singaporean”” despite having lived overseas for over a decade. This level of pride is all because of what you’ve done to make what Singapore is today and what Singapore as a country stand for.

We have no doubt lost a great leader, a Titan. But rest in peace knowing that your work will see more Singaporeans stepping up, more leaders being created and more leaders striving to be like you.

Rest in peace Mr. Lee Kuan Yew.
Jessie Goh

I came migrated to Singapore as a 10 year old in 1970, together with my family. I’ve considered myself a Singaporean since and renounced my Malaysian citizenship at the age of 21.


I was a product of a country that offered peace, stability, HDB flat ownership for most families, almost free education for all and jobs for everyone. Yet, in my 20s, with my university education I still was not able to understand the vision, determination and hard work of Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his team to bring us that far. I saw a comfortable if not luxurious life full of possibilities. Therefore, I chaffed at the reins of what I felt was a patriachial PM who wanted to control every little decision its citizens made. I found many of his policies and pronouncements infuriating. Why was he was always talking about survival and how Singapore needed to keep working very hard to survive in those seemingly difficult times?

Reflecting on Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s legacy, I realized I had progressed from 1-room rental flats when I first came to Singapore, to a 4-room flat and after marriage an executive maisonette and finally to a freehold condominium. My family and I have not done too shabbily.

It must have really been tough for Mr Lee to share his vision with people who could not understand him. Yet, he persevered, sticking to what he thought was right for Singaporeans and cajoled, pushed and literally dragged us from Third World to First World status in less than 50 years.

In this past week, it is obvious that everyone has hindsight. But I do not know of anyone with the vision, clarity, tenacity and incorruptibility of Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Yes, he was patriachial but he was like that even with his own family and he loved Singaporeans like he loved his own family and only wanted us to not only survive but prosper on this Little Red Dot.

Thank You Mr Lee Kuan Yew for dedicating your life to building a Singapore we’re proud to call home.
Fang Mei Ling

from the bottom of my heart…..
My dearest father Lee Kuan Yew, it is so painful to say good-bye to you. You have done so much for us Singaporeans, for whom you have sacrificed your life. If not for you, we will remain as a small dot in the world and nobody would have noticed us. It is because of you that the whole big world is talking about this small dot that is called Singapore. You made the world turned in our direction with admiration. You made every citizen of other countries to yearn for a leader like you. Such is the admiration you get from all around the world. You gave us recognition and respect. Wherever we go in the world we are well received and respected. All these will never be true if not for you. I grew up in a poor family where basic necessities were of questions. But today my kids are living in much comfort. You made education for all compulsory and took away from us all poverty and misery. All these will never be true if not for you. You made opportunities for us to come up in our life and made a difference in each and everyone’s life. I can’t thank you enough Sir Lee Kuan Yew. 50 years ago you cried for Singapore when it was separated from Malaya. Now 50 years later, Singapore is crying for you. How I wish you were immortal but god made you mortal. Now time as come to say good-bye to you. My heart is very painful and my tears doesn’t stop rolling. Good-bye my dear father. You will always be immortal in our memory. Thank you my father for teaching us the great qualities of a great man. God bless your great soul and your family. Love you very much Sir. Rest in peace Mr Lee Kuan Yew!!
Kala Kalaithasan

Dearest Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
In your presence you touched our lives, in your passing you stirred our hearts!


Your accomplishments requires no further elaboration through words because they are facts and truths.

Thousands of miles away from home, knowing what thousands are doing and feeling back home, reading the thousands of words being expressed in The Straits Times everyday, I am afraid a thousand words will not express my thoughts and sentiments now.

But I wish to tell you this. In this week of national mourning, I have become convinced that we do have a Singapore Spirit. It is one that is the personification of you; Disciplined, determined, truthful, hardworking, desire to learn, improve oneself continuously and more.

With this Singapore Spirit, I believe that Singapore will have many good years to come.

So, may you rest in peace.

Yours respectfully,
Lim Kee Hua

It is difficult to add to the various tributes already published about this great leader of ours. As a Singaporean PR I have been amazed at what this great leader has achieved for the nation and fellow Singaporeans. I believe Mr. Lee was one among few truly visionary leaders in this world. He was a tough and fair leader driven by a deep personal vision to build Singapore to a world class nation and to provide fellow Singaporeans a life of opportunity comparable with the best in this planet. He achieved both in his lifetime and leaves behind a strong and stable legacy . He will be missed by all of us deeply in this world and I salute him, his sacrifice and dedication, and pray for his soul.
K B Ravindranath Menon

Dearest Mr Lee, Founder of Singapore,
No words can describe my sadness on your departure.
You possessed all the traits of a great leader, in fact much more.
It was your undivided and selfless love that make brings this country to what it is today.


For the past few days, I have learnt more about you through the interviews on television programmes and articles I read in the newspapers. You and your team have built and transformed Singapore into a world class nation, well regarded by the world despite we being just a small little red dot in the world map. Singapore’s success will not be possible if not for your hardship, perseverance and toil that you have gone through and overcome during those difficult years.

You are a role model to all and will be dearly missed by all Singaporeans. Please continue to guard and watch over us in wherever you are. May you rest in peace and be reunited with Mrs Lee.
Goodbye Mr Lee, you will always have a place deep down in my heart.
Lee Sheue Yiuh

To the Singaporean’s beloved Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
Leaders over the world admire and envy us for having such a remarkable founding father. Some even said that Singaporean do not know how to appreciate and feel without gratitude for having such a brilliant leader that have built our nation.

From the day when Mr Lee KY’s passing was announced till the funeral procession’s day, thousands of people were deeply saddened, their sympathy and wanting to pay the last respect attitude during these few days was touching. What can people prove? l believed that every Singaporean knows when and what to respond.

To the majority, Mr Lee KY is not just the first prime minister of Singapore, they even described him as a mighty guardian that sent by God. His journey may have ended on 23 March 2015, but his legacy will lives on. Mr Lee KY is the legend of Singapore.

Thank you Mr Lee, for dedicating your whole life for Singapore that’s we now called home. I’m not a well educated person or a rich entrepreneurs . I am just a ordinary family man. But if there comes to a day where Singapore goes to a war, what I can contribute to our country is to protect her till my dying breath.

One thing for sure ,there are still many Singaporean who are willing and ready to sacrifice for this island city when time has come.

I hope that the government would declare 23 March as a holiday for all future generations Singaporean to remember this great legend of the century.

Farewell Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
Gary Wee

Many Australians share a profound respect for Mr Lee and revere his courage, dignity, profound wisdom and nation-building acumen. We consider him a friend of Australia and many of us wish he was one of our own. Many years ago, he warned us that ‘Australians would become the poor white trash of Asia’ unless economic reform was instituted – a remark which stung Australian politicians to action. To call yourself a ‘mate’ is one thing; however only the very best friend of all will tell you when you are on the wrong path. We say that he was a very great friend indeed.

痛失一位这么勇悍，富责任感，具远见和智慧的领导者，心情实是无比哀痛。然而沉溺在深深的哀悼时，别忘了回报他最好的方式是好好地生活，力求种族和谐，社会安定和继续发展。


让我们一起向这位一代巨人深深地鞠躬，因为有他，才有现在的新加坡!

别忘了人家是建立一个家庭，而李先生不只建立一个家庭而且还建立了一个国家! 我们应该把沉痛的心，忆念他的心，转化成力量，竭力把现在的新加坡维持下去或甚至打造得更完美! 我相信这样，李先生他会很高兴的。
安息吧！我们的建国总理李光耀先生。
您会永在怀念中。
Ong Siew Gek

Dear Mr Lee,
Your legacy never dies because to live in the hearts of your people and the first rate nation that you built – is to live forever. Your contributions and personal sacrifices will remain unmatched for decades. We owe an unspeakable debt of gratitude for the epitome of service before self, for your wisd


Rest in peace.
JM

Dear Mr Lee, a simple thank you is not able to express the gratitude we have for you. Without you, there won’t be a Singapore today. Along side with the pioneer Singaporeans, you have built a safe, clean and fair country for our children. As long, you work hard you will be treated fairly and have a chance to be successful.


When I drive to work yesterday, I saw the flowers along ECP are all blossomed beautifully which is a sight I never seen before. As if it’s saying good bye to the gardener of Singapore, Mr Lee Kuan Yew!

Thank you Sir for everything. May you rest in peace!
Jacky

Thank you for making Singapore as what it is today. Without your tremendous effort in helping out with Singapore’s economy, Singapore will not be as advanced and as beautiful. Thank you for sacrificing your entire life just to help Singapore to be a better place for Singaporeans and foreigners to live in. Your ‘Plant a tree campaign’ helped Singapore to be clean and green and Singapore owned the title, “”Garden City””.


Mr Lee Kuan Yew also pursued in Singapore’s education system, to allow every Singaporean child to have the opportunity to be bilingual, therefore, resulting in the Lee Kuan Yew bilingual scholarship.
Thank you for all your wonderful contributions and striving so hard just to make Singapore a better place. Now, all your hard work, tears and sweat have all paid off.
Once again, I would like to say a sincere and grateful thank you to you, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the Founding Father of Singapore. I am very proud to tell others that I am Singaporean and I can call Singapore my home.

饮水思源

Yours sincerely,
Valentina Tan

I’m sorry that I couldn’t make it to the Parliament House to pay my respects personally. Instead, I’ve went to one of the community sites instead. I hope you don’t mind that..


No amount of thank you can suffice the contributions and sacrifices that you’ve made for this nation that I’m proud to call Home. But still, Thank you Sir. You’ve worked so hard for Singapore, thinking about her for every living breath you’ve had. You were selfless, placing Singapore above anything else. You’ve been a great inspiration to many of us, and I’m sure you will continue to be for the future generations.

It has been extremely heartwarming to see Singaporeans queuing to pay their last respects for you, and the kindness from my fellow Singaporeans. And Sir, this is all because of you. Growing up, I’ve always thought of Singaporeans as selfish and un-united. But they’ve proven me so wrong, and I thank you Mr Lee, for uniting us Singaporeans once again.

You’ve done so much and it’s time to take a break. As much as my heart is heavy with sorrow, I’m also glad that you’re free from pain and suffering, and that you’re finally reunited with your love of your life. Thank you too, Mrs Lee, for without you, Mr Lee would be a different person, and Singapore might have not been how she is now. I hope that both of you can continue to watch over us from wherever you are, and know that because of the strong foundation that you’ve given us, we will make Singapore shine even brighter than she is now on the world map.

Thank you and Rest in Peace Sir.
Yijun

Rest in peace esteemed Mr Lee Kuan Yew. i am deeply saddened by your passing. With your passing, it has created a void in Singapore and the hearts of all Singaporeans. But it will be filled with a fond memory of you and all that you have done and fought all your life for Singapore to be what it is today. For that we are eternally grateful. Today as always,I stand proud to be a Singaporean. Anywhere we go we reply with pride that we are from Singapore and with the equal pride when people from all walks of life and country acknowledge with envy what Singapore stand for.


Blessed are we Singaporeans to have had you to guide us and lead us through the times. Even with your passing, your spirit lives on. We will never forget.

In Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s own words: “You begin your journey not knowing where it will take you. You have plans, you have dreams, but every now and again you have to take uncharted roads, face impassable mountains, cross treacherous rivers, be blocked by landslides and earthquakes. That’s the way my life has been.”

“”But we are not an easy-going people. We cannot help thinking, calculating and planning for tomorrow, for next week, for next month, for next year, for the next generation. And it is because we have restless minds, forever probing and testing, seeking new and better solutions to old and new problems, that we have never been, and I trust never shall be, tried and found wanting.’””

With heartfelt gratitude, thank you esteemed Mr. Lee Kuan Yew. Rest in peace.

Dear Mr Lee,
Since the day you left us, I have watched so many videos of your younger days when you did your rally speeches. I have watched how you fought for the independence of Singapore and have admired your conviction and determination in building up a nation. I am deeply touched whenever I witness your devotion for Mrs Lee. You are so much more than I thought I knew about you.


Thank you, Mr Lee. Thank you for your years of hard work and commitment in building this nation. Everything that we are enjoying now, is the fruits of your labor.

I have been thinking these few days on how I can best pay tribute to you, to thank you for all that you have done. I guess the best way that I can possibly do, is to promise you that wherever that I might be in the years to come, I will still come back to Singapore, the nation that makes me proud, the roots of my identity and the home where I belong.

Just yesterday, my friend asked me all of a sudden, whether will I leave Singapore and migrate to another country for retirement. I told her, “”never”” I will not leave behind a nation which is built on tears and sweats by our forefathers. I promise to treasure Singapore and all that has been built for us.

May you rest in peace. You will forever be in my heart and the hearts of our fellow Singaporeans.

Dear Mr Lee,
I am nine this year. Mummy and Daddy took me to the p.house to see you. But I only see Singapore flag. Mummy told me that is you.


You have built a nation so so pretty. I love all the flowers in the park. Big kisses and thank you

Janet Lim

Dear Mr Lee,
We have not met each other,but you have managed to touch my life in many ways.without Yew,Singapore will not be Singapore today.My life is through the hard works of yours.
Ah gong,thank you for your sacrifice what you have done are for this nation,for the people in Singapore.I am proud to be a Singaporean. You may lay your burden down now. Singapore will miss you with love and admiration.


Miss you forever
MK.Low

I am who I am today, a proud and grateful Singaporean, because of you.
My father was an ardent supporter and my mother a quiet admirer. The rest of us in the family were devotees. Yes, in many ways you were our supreme guide and we believed in you.
You did not fail us.
Your dynamism, dedication, deep sense of duty, brilliance and discipline are few of the many virtues that we were in awe of and, in our modest ways, tried to emulate.
My family and I will forever be grateful to you for sacrificing yourself for our nation.
In the next karmic cycle, I wish to be somewhere close enough to you to be able to serve you. In the meantime, a part of you will always be with me.
Here is a virtual farewell hug…which may displease you, but what the heck, you are our father – the father of Singapore.
See you soon .

Dearest Mr Lee,
You are a remarkable and respectable leader that made a difference during tumultuous times. We are glad and grateful that we have you as our founding father. Your dreams, convictions, dedicated lifelong service had changed an unsightly fish village into a pleasant, safe and peaceful country, a bustling and cosmopolitan city where we are proud to call home.

Under your remarkable leadership with you team, leading a group of elite and hardworking fellow mates, people of young generations are the beneficiaries of the fruit of your labour. Without you making a difference during the tumultuous times, travelling to different destinations, Singapore won’t be what it is today.

Although you have left us, your legacy, passion and perseverance will live on forever. We are grateful and honoured to be part of the generations where we witnessed your remarkable leadership. Though you won’t be able to witness the changes with us, we know that you are watching over us at your new home with Mrs. Lee.

50 years ago, you shed tears for the nation. 50 years later, the nation you have dedicate your life shed tears for you. You brave through challenges in building a nation, you walked till the end of your journey bravely despite all circumstances. Nothing stands your way is what I have witness through days of mourning. It clearly shown that you have touched the lives of people you accounted for, Singaporeans from all walks of life and even across island wide.

Thank you for all the sacrifices you made for us, your dedicated lifelong commitment and contributions to Singapore. No amount of words can expressed our heartfelt gratitude. You have left a great assets to the Singaporeans of generations. Thank you for everything, for what you have done for the nation, the people you are accounted for. You’ll be deeply remembered in our hearts, our founding father. May you rest peacefully and reunite with Mrs. Lee in your new home.

Thank you Mr. Lee for your dedicated lifelong service to this nation and provide a safe and low crime home for people you accounted for.
Our humbled deepest condolences to Mr PM Lee and family. May you and your family brave through all challenges in life. Thank you for letting us, Singaporeans grace the final journey of late Mr. Lee with you.
With heartfelt gratitude,
Anson Lim, Lina Yeo, Serene Ong, Katherine Kraylene.L, Eileen Ng

I’ve never actually really thought about this… It seemed to me as though Mr Lee Kuan Yew would live on forever and the news of his death hit me like a freight train when I first read about it on my way to school on Monday morning.
His death was inevitable, but deep down, I was desperately hoping that he would hang in there, at least until the 9th of August, to celebrate SG50 with all of us. Now, though, I am a touch comforted by the fact that his suffering has ceased, and that he has reunited with his wife.
He was a magnificent man and Singapore will never see a man and leader as marvellous as Mr Lee Kuan Yew. He was truly a great leader who gave his all for his country, who made Singapore what it is today. Without him, there’ll be nothing. To this man who made it all happen, thank you so much. Your contributions were tremendous to say the least, your love for the country was amazing, your dedication to Singapore, all your efforts, your blood, sweat and tears… We thank you from the bottom of our hearts and we will not let you down; we will continue to make Singapore shine, prosper and flourish. I hope as you look down at us from the skies, you’ll be proud of us. We’ll keep your legacy alive and every Singaporean, no matter present or future, will know your name, your great deeds, and carry on the legacy.

You led Singapore in times of adversity and poverty. You gave your time and life to transformed a sleepy hollow into a global metropolitan. You crafted policies and developed Singapore using your model. You made the little red dot known to everyone from the East to the West. You worked relentlessly for the future of your people. You had been ostracized and condemned for your style. You never succumbed to criticism and rivals. You led your way and did your best for your homeland.


You deserve my utmost respect and deep admiration. Mr Lee Kuan Yew, thank you for being a wonderful statesman. Rest in peace

Mr Lee is Singapore personified. With his passing, an era of possibly a golden era for Singapore.


Born in 1962, I grew up as Singapore grew from a GDP of slightly higher than $500, highest in SE Asia, to over $55,000, one of the highest in the world. I experienced how it was like to be in the third world to first.

Singapore and Singaporeans owns a great debt to men of the calibre of Lee Kuan Yew, Goh Keng Swee, Toh Chin Chai, S Rajaretnam, Lim Kim San, Devan Nair, Hon Sui Sen, and many of the founding fathers. As PM, LKY is the first of the founding fathers. Without them, their patriotism and committment, Singapore is most likely to be a bleak dark dot, instead we have become a bright red dot.

Due to my work, I had been to many countries, least developed or developing nations – Jamaica, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, Sudan, Nepal, Mozambique, Mauritius, Maldives, South Africa, Panama, Colombia, Papau New Guinea – all developing nations.

Some of these, had higher GDP than Singapore, in the sixties.

One vivid ocassion was in Sri Lanka.
I read that Sri Lanka or then Ceylon, was considered a pearl in the Indian Ocean, clustered in a relatively area of peace, unlike Singapore, then battling the communist red tide in S E Asia. Sri Lankans have the bright people. Alas, racial strife wrecked the country for over 30 years.

After a presentation on Singapore’s TradeNet, a Sri Lankan gentleman came to me and thrust me a book he had written.

It was about LKY and what he had done in Singapore, and lessons for Sir Lankans. He expressed profusely about LKY, and I was bemused and slightly embarrassed.

I didn’t yet, fully appreciate that Singapore could have been like Ceylon, if not for the wise policies of multi-racism and bilingualism of Lee and the Old Guards.

As a Singaporean, I did not benefit of all Singapore had to offer. I did not have a benefit of a university education in Singapore, no thanks to the education policies. My gratitude for my university education goes to Australia.

However, LKY’s Singapore provided a conducive environment for me to find jobs and earn a living for myself and my family. The golden era of Singapore in the last 50 years is such, that I did not find emigrating to larger countries like Australia, or the US, enticing. I choose to stay in Singapore, because no where is better or as comfortable as my Singapore home.

Thank you Mr Lee, without you and the Old Guards, your abiding passion for Singapore, had given us this golden era we had in the last 50 years.

I only hope that your younger successors in the Government, and the PAP will have the same kind of indomitable spirit, and the abiding passion for Singapore, to lead Singapore to a even golden era for the future generations of Singaporeans.
Koh Tat Tsen

Many Australians share a profound respect for Mr Lee and revere his courage, dignity, profound wisdom and nation-building acumen. We consider him a friend of Australia and many of us wish he was one of our own. Many years ago, he warned us that ‘Australians would become the poor white trash of Asia’ unless economic reform was instituted – a remark which stung Australian politicians to action. To call yourself a ‘mate’ is one thing; however only the very best friend of all will tell you when you are on the wrong path. We say that he was a very great friend indeed.

痛失一位这么勇悍，富责任感，具远见和智慧的领导者，心情实是无比哀痛。然而沉溺在深深的哀悼时，别忘了回报他最好的方式是好好地生活，力求种族和谐，社会安定和继续发展。


让我们一起向这位一代巨人深深地鞠躬，因为有他，才有现在的新加坡!

别忘了人家是建立一个家庭，而李先生不只建立一个家庭而且还建立了一个国家! 我们应该把沉痛的心，忆念他的心，转化成力量，竭力把现在的新加坡维持下去或甚至打造得更完美! 我相信这样，李先生他会很高兴的。
安息吧！我们的建国总理李光耀先生。
您会永在怀念中。
Ong Siew Gek

Thank you for making Singapore as what it is today. Without your tremendous effort in helping out with Singapore’s economy, Singapore will not be as advanced and as beautiful. Thank you for sacrificing your entire life just to help Singapore to be a better place for Singaporeans and foreigners to live in. Your ‘Plant a tree campaign’ helped Singapore to be clean and green and Singapore owned the title, “”Garden City””.


Mr Lee Kuan Yew also pursued in Singapore’s education system, to allow every Singaporean child to have the opportunity to be bilingual, therefore, resulting in the Lee Kuan Yew bilingual scholarship.
Thank you for all your wonderful contributions and striving so hard just to make Singapore a better place. Now, all your hard work, tears and sweat have all paid off.
Once again, I would like to say a sincere and grateful thank you to you, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the Founding Father of Singapore. I am very proud to tell others that I am Singaporean and I can call Singapore my home.

Yours sincerely,
Valentina Tan

I’m sorry that I couldn’t make it to the Parliament House to pay my respects personally. Instead, I’ve went to one of the community sites instead. I hope you don’t mind that..


No amount of thank you can suffice the contributions and sacrifices that you’ve made for this nation that I’m proud to call Home. But still, Thank you Sir. You’ve worked so hard for Singapore, thinking about her for every living breath you’ve had. You were selfless, placing Singapore above anything else. You’ve been a great inspiration to many of us, and I’m sure you will continue to be for the future generations.

It has been extremely heartwarming to see Singaporeans queuing to pay their last respects for you, and the kindness from my fellow Singaporeans. And Sir, this is all because of you. Growing up, I’ve always thought of Singaporeans as selfish and un-united. But they’ve proven me so wrong, and I thank you Mr Lee, for uniting us Singaporeans once again.

You’ve done so much and it’s time to take a break. As much as my heart is heavy with sorrow, I’m also glad that you’re free from pain and suffering, and that you’re finally reunited with your love of your life. Thank you too, Mrs Lee, for without you, Mr Lee would be a different person, and Singapore might have not been how she is now. I hope that both of you can continue to watch over us from wherever you are, and know that because of the strong foundation that you’ve given us, we will make Singapore shine even brighter than she is now on the world map.

Thank you and Rest in Peace Sir.
Yijun

Dear Mr Lee, a simple thank you is not able to express the gratitude we have for you. Without you, there won’t be a Singapore today. Along side with the pioneer Singaporeans, you have built a safe, clean and fair country for our children. As long, you work hard you will be treated fairly and have a chance to be successful.


When I drive to work yesterday, I saw the flowers along ECP are all blossomed beautifully which is a sight I never seen before. As if it’s saying good bye to the gardener of Singapore, Mr Lee Kuan Yew!

Thank you Sir for everything. May you rest in peace!
Jacky

Rest in peace esteemed Mr Lee Kuan Yew. i am deeply saddened by your passing. With your passing, it has created a void in Singapore and the hearts of all Singaporeans. But it will be filled with a fond memory of you and all that you have done and fought all your life for Singapore to be what it is today. For that we are eternally grateful. Today as always,I stand proud to be a Singaporean. Anywhere we go we reply with pride that we are from Singapore and with the equal pride when people from all walks of life and country acknowledge with envy what Singapore stand for.


Blessed are we Singaporeans to have had you to guide us and lead us through the times. Even with your passing, your spirit lives on. We will never forget.

In Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s own words: “You begin your journey not knowing where it will take you. You have plans, you have dreams, but every now and again you have to take uncharted roads, face impassable mountains, cross treacherous rivers, be blocked by landslides and earthquakes. That’s the way my life has been.”

“”But we are not an easy-going people. We cannot help thinking, calculating and planning for tomorrow, for next week, for next month, for next year, for the next generation. And it is because we have restless minds, forever probing and testing, seeking new and better solutions to old and new problems, that we have never been, and I trust never shall be, tried and found wanting.’””

With heartfelt gratitude, thank you esteemed Mr. Lee Kuan Yew. Rest in peace.

While reading through the condolences, I’m reminded of a couple of lines from Paulo Coelho’s Aleph:

“”Words are tears that have been written down. Tears are words that need to be shed. Without them, joy loses all its brilliance and sadness has no end.””

Was struck by the profound connection between words and tears. The many tributes have contained words of gratitude towards our founding father, while eulogies by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his brother Lee Hsien Yang have certainly struck a chord in the hearts of those who have loved and lost. The tears of those grieving speak volumes of the immense respect for MM Lee Kuan Yew.

I’ve been very touched by the eulogies. MM Lee Kuan Yew has led a sparkling life and the anecdotes that were shared showed a softer side, a side that all of us can relate to, a side that we’ll fondly remember.

My heartfelt prayers go out to Prime Minister Lee’s family. Know that our thoughts are with you during this difficult time.

Saraspathy Menon

Dear Mr Lee,
When the whole world doubted we will survive, waiting for us to fail, you proved to them that Singapore can survive without natural resources, without merging with our neighbour, without colonial power.


You further proved to the world, that Singapore can grow and prosper, and do better than her neighbours that are many times bigger in size, population, and resources.

You united and inspired the people of Singapore to work hard for our survival, to be resilient and undaunted.

You reminded us not to be complacent with our achievements, but to stay ahead of competition.

You were not afraid to implement unpopular policies that will do good to the nation.

You upheld the country’s integrity and dignity by keeping it corruption free and not allowing other countries to tell us how Singapore should be run.

You built a country that is strong and free, that we call Home, that we are proud of.

With Mrs Lee, you have taught us true love and devotion to a long-lasting marriage.

You taught us the core values of upbringing our next generation.

Your lifetime contributions to Singapore are beyond what words can describe. We have so much to learn from each of them.

You have worked hard for your entire life for Singapore and her people.

You can finally rest and be reunited with Mrs Lee.
Thank you for all your teachings, Mr Lee.

You will be dearly missed by the people of Singapore.
Lynn Hwee

Being born in the 90’s, by then I had a stable home to live in, clean water to drink and bath in, a good education system. I had no idea what poverty was till I got older and saw images of people from Africa having to both drink and bath using mud water. It was then that I felt very very lucky to have been born and raised in Singapore.


From being a newly independent country back in 1965, I am amazed at how you, Sir, has stepped forward to lead and transform us from a third world country to first world with your courage, foresight, determination, and firmness within a short span of time. How big of a role you must have played for us in the international stage too.

I may not have met you before, you may not have impacted my life directly, but it feels as though I’ve lost a grandfather if I may say. You have done a tremendous amount of things for your people, your country, for your entire life. There will never be another magnanimous man like you again.

I hope you’ll have a good rest now, thank you very very much, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

Dear beloved Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


I regret that I only get to know so much more about your sacrifices, thoughts and concerns for Singapore after your passing.

Your passion, tenacity and decisive actions have helped Singapore overcome its darkest moments and challenges through the last 50 years. Your farsightedness has given us a stable and able government; a capable team of younger leaders to carry us through the next chapter of the Singapore story.

No amount of words or actions can fully express my heartfelt gratitude. Please accept this as a small token of my appreciation. Your fearless fighting spirit will continue to live on.

Rest in peace Mr Lee.
Danny Kwok Wai Chung

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


We have been truly blessed as a nation to have benefited from your strong foresight, leadership and governance. You shouldered tremendous responsibility in steering Singapore to economic excellence and gave us all a sustainable home. My generation has been so fortunate – we did not live through the tumultuous times, but the lessons learnt will be deeply etched in my mind and for this I am eternally grateful.

We will continue to champion your spirit of excellence and make you proud of us for generations to come. I am so proud to call myself a Singaporean and I will tell my future children all about what you have done for Singapore. Thank you for first believing in us. God bless you and your family.
Kong Yi Ling

Dear Sir,
It is with a heavy heart that I am writing this. I have not had the chance to meet you in person. The closest distance between us was when I paid my final respect to you at the Parliament House.


Our founding father, I would like to say “Thank You, Sir” from the bottom of my heart for dedicating your life to Singapore. From a third world country to the first, those tough decision and leadership that you have to make, our clean water, garden city, home ownership, and many more… Without your dedication to build this little red dot, Singapore will not be what it is today. You have definitely made a huge impact not only to all Singaporean but to the world. We are blessed to have you as our leader. I am proud to be a Singaporean and we will unite to continue your legacy.

I am also deeply moved by your love for Mrs Lee and am glad that you now can now be reunited with her.

Rest in peace, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. We will miss you deeply and you will live on, deep in our hearts always.
Elaine Tang

Dear Mr Lee,
I thank God as He has blessed Singapore with a visionary leader that love this country and willing to give his whole life to build this a better place for generation after generation. As I travel very often, Singapore is always the only place I feel like home. Even as I’m married to a British person, and grant me a good opportunity to change my citizenship but this has never been my thoughts as I’m proud to be a Singaporean.


It is definitely our great loss of your departure but we can see that your final days, you had brought the entire Nation closely together as one Singapore. In addition, we can see publicly declare your contributions via social media were overwhelming and once again remember your contributions to this country.

May the comfort and peace of God with Your family and once again I thank you for what you had done and I had been so much interested in Singapore history because of you.
Serene Lee

Farewell, Mr Lee Kuan Yew

…… The Founding Father of our Nation;

….. the Founding Partner of our Firm.

+++

We join the multitudes to mourn the physical loss of your comforting presence.

You gave your best to lead us to achieve so much in your illustrious and long life. Your eminence as the guiding light and moving inspiration was not just for our nation but also the international and global stage!

Your exemplary, indomitable and sacrificial spirit in demanding excellence first from yourself, even as you lead and demand from others around you, has galvanized and made Singapore to what it is. You gave your life… but the past few days have shown that even in death, your spirit lives on to galvanize and move the multitudes for good!

We are proud that the same spirit of excellence and integrity by which you established Lee & Lee with your fellow founding partners, has been entrenched through the past 60 years into our hearts, our hopes, and our aims.

No one like you shall pass our way again… but we shall be forever grateful and humbled that we are direct beneficiaries of your legacy as our rich heritage.

On our part, we shall persevere with dedication, inspired by all that you are and have left for us.

Rest in Peace… Mr Lee Kuan Yew

“Though nothing can bring back the hour of splendor in the grass, glory in the flower, we will grieve not; rather find strength in what remains behind.” – William Wordsworth

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
Me and my family was deeply saddened when we hear about the news on Monday of you passing away. We offer our deepest condolences to Mr Lee’s family as losing a family member is never easy. 50 years ago you have cried for our country and all of us, now we will mourn and cry for you as we have lost one of the best leader of Singapore. We have always been thankful that we lived in Singapore as it has been a safe and clean country and it is all thanks to you that our country has been in this way.

Many thanks to Mr Lee for giving all of your entire life into building Singapore up from a 3rd world country which was a village to a 1st world country which is now a Metropolis City. It is because of your all your blood, sweat and tears that everyone in Singapore gets to live a enjoyable life with all the necessities required.

Singapore is a miracle that you have created. You have created a place whereby many of us can live peacefully. Thanks to your leadership and all of your efforts that all of this is possible for all of us. I am sure that every Singaporeans will be very proud for having Singapore as their home and having you as our founding father of our home. Even though Singapore does not have any natural resources to build up, we have one good leader that lead us and stand up for our country and this is even better than having those natural resources.

Many new generations will not know how much sacrifices you have made to build this country to where it is now. One of the world wealthiest and most developed countries. They also wont know what is it like to live in a 3rd world country and the sufferings. Many of us take things for granted and only express our thoughts when it is too late. But Mr Lee, thanks to you that the new generations won’t have to go through those sufferings.

No words can ever express our gratitude to you for everything that you have given up for our country and for all fellow Singaporeans. We are blessed to live in Singapore, the fruits of your labour. Your legacy will be carried on by all Singaporeans and the memory of you will continue to live and be respected in our hearts. Let Singapore be all Singaporeans burden from now on and we will shoulder it and continue to bring the country to greater heights. May you rest in peace and God bless you.

Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, it is with a great sense of gratitude that I paid my final respects to you in the wee hours of 26 March 2015.


The beauty, orderliness and cleanliness of modern Singapore owe their beginnings to you and the capable team that you assembled in our early years.

Empowered with vision, you saw the potential of modern Singapore and worked tirelessly towards building a nation that we are now proud to call our own.

Your strength as a leader has not gone unnoticed by our neighbours or the international community. It was this strength that galvanised a people of diverse backgrounds and beliefs. It is this strength that won you the respect of your people and those around you.

Leadership is, indeed, no easy task. Despite much opposition, you made difficult decisions, many of which you believed were for the good of our island nation. Many of these decisions turned out to be the correct ones. Of course, being as human as the rest of us, there is no doubt that mistakes were made. Some policies were unpopular and some actions were controversial. Nevertheless, it is my belief that these were outcomes that were already weighed and discussed. It is inconceivable that a man blessed with such foresight would not imagine the results of his words, actions and decisions.

Mr. Lee, I believe that you did the best you could with what you had and I am immensely appreciative that we had a leader who was as courageous as you even in the toughest of times. Thank you, Sir, for trailblazing us to where we are today.

Though I have not known you in person, I know that your heart and soul were devoted to the rise of modern Singapore. Though I have not seen you in person, I see the vision you had all those years ago in the fruit of your labour all around me. Though I have not heard you speak in person, I have witnessed the gravitas and power of the words that you have spoken.

In your passing, we are deeply grieved at the loss of one of our great founding fathers. Thank you, Mr. Lee, for all that you have done for us. You have served this nation with your life – a life that will be forever inscribed in the annals of history, never replaced, never forgotten.
Remus Zhong

Sir,
I was born in the 60s when you made Prime Minister. My family and I lived in a kampong in Poh Huat Road, off Upper Serangoon Road. As kids growing up, we felt the impact of every policy you made such as Speak Mandarin Campaign, Housing Policy, 2 is enough, etc.. We cared less about the impact of your policies because we were more interested in flying kites, catching birds and fishing in the ponds. Sometimes, we would listen to the adults as they gather to talk about your plans for our neighbourhood and the country. My grandfather was a civil servant then and he would leak some information about the Government plan. As kids, we sat there listening and watching the reaction of the elders. Some were angry especially with regards to the land acquisition act. Some were elated to hear that they could finally have a proper home to live in. As you can imagine, kampong houses back then were made of attap and zinc roofs, wooden beams and walls (infested with termites) and erratic electricity supply (especially during rainy days when the overhead power cables would snap because a branch fell on it).


Today, as I look around me, I understand why you had to do what you need to do. I see the fruits of your labour. Some of your policies were hard to stomach but we trusted you and you delivered. For that, we will forever be grateful. You have done your job and you paid for it with your life. Nobody will ever come close to achieving what you have done. Nobody can ever emulate you. Whenever I see videos and pictures of you, one word comes into my mind; style. That’s right, style. The way you carried yourself, interact with higher dignitaries, communicate with people from all walks of life, understanding their needs and passion, being firm and even ferocious when needed, sympathetic and caring to those around you and jovial at the right time are qualities which resonates with me.

As an ex-Naval Officer, you were also my Commander-in-Chief. If you had shouted ‘charge’, you can be sure a thousand sailors will set sail and defend this country with our lives. This is our home which you have built for us and anybody who tries to take it away from us will feel the might of our guns and missiles. This country is truly worth fighting for.

As you proceed to your final resting place, I want you to know that your ship is in good hands. The Command team has proven themselves and the morale of the crew is high. There will be some slackers but don’t worry, we will sort them out! Bon Voyage Sir Lee Kuan Yew, you were the best Commander any officer can work for. Pipe the still……

Receiving the Prime Minister’s Book Prize in 1984 was one of the high points (if not the highest) of my school days. As I join fellow Singaporeans in saluting Mr Lee, I look back in wonder, not just at that honour I had received from LKY himself, but also at his foresight in establishing the policy on bilingualism.


It is often said that we must give our children both roots and wings. In a way, that is what bilingualism has done for Singaporeans. Our mother tongue keeps us rooted in our culture, while English serves as a portal to the wider world – in effect, giving us wings. I look back in wonder and respect as this was just one of many things he set in motion with his astounding foresight.

Anyone can dream, but it takes someone special, with extraordinary courage and determination, to translate that dream into a vision, and galvanise an entire nation to march with him to realise that vision. That march, though glorious, has undoubtedly been a long and difficult one.

Rest in peace, Sir.

With deep and abiding respect

It is saddening to wake up to the news of passing of Mr Lee Kuan Yew on the morning of 23th March 2015. On that very day, the whole of Singapore became very silent. I was on the train to work at SGH and the whole journey was quiet and reflective. Everyone in the train was quiet, solemn and you can see some who are upset. Upon reaching SGH, I took a longer detour toward the Quad outside SGH Blk 7 and see a couple of visitors shedding tears. It was indeed a saddening day for the whole nation because we have lost a great man who have built Singapore from nothing to what it is today.


It is sometimes we don’t realise that our country is beautiful, clean and safe until we lose it. We can actually feel it everyday. For example, walking on the streets at 3am and you know that you will be safe. Moreover, we can see the lush greenery that spread out throughout the streets of Singapore including the trees opposite my house are blooming with flowers of white and pink colour.

Your dedications to make Singapore better over the last 50 plus years has shown results and I totally appreciate that. It is your leadership and capabilities to work with your team that brought us to what we are today. I am thankful and blessed to have you as our founding father. No words or actions can compare to what you have done for this country. You will be always be in my heart and in every hearts of every Singaporean.

Thank you Mr Lee, without Yew, there is no us.

Rest in peace, Mr Lee! I am sure that Singapore will be in good hands.

Majulah Singapura!

To the greatest leader of all,
There are many great leaders that has written history, Mr Lee Kuan Yew is however the one that not only do I respect most, but also the one that all Singaporean owe most. Without Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s great fore sight, plans, strategies and belief in Singapore and our fellow country people, we will not have even achieved half of what we have today. From a small fishing village to a first world nation, under the leadership on one statesman, at the same time facing the challenge of no natural resources and many others problem, Mr Lee Kuan Yew has exceeded mankind expectation and limitation.


Thank you Mr Lee for shaping Singapore into what she is today so that each of us has a much better standard of living. I thank you sincerely with all my heart and I will always be proud to say that I am a Singaporean. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.

RIP Mr Lee,

Yours Sincerely,
Wong Wei Kai

I thank you from the bottom of my heart, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, for fighting courageously in the beginning for the independence and survival of Singapore; and for your wisdom in guiding the younger generations of leaders, both locally and internationally, to make Singapore and the world at large a more stable and peaceful place to live in.


You have made our little red dot larger than what it appears and for the whole world to recognise and respect us. I promise to try my utmost best to make Singapore a better place to grow old and die.

The outpouring of tributes for the past few days is befitting a man like you. You have demonstrated great compassion throughout your life, and to a Buddhist like me, this is a mark of a great being, a Bodhisattva.

Mr Lee Kuan Yew, thank you for your most dedicated efforts to bring Singapore to what our great home is today. You are truly an amazing man, who gave us hope for a better future at Singapore’s most desperate times in the 1960s and truly an excellent leader who brought us better days over the years.


50 years ago, Mr Lee, you brought us together as one united people
50 years later, Mr Lee, you brought us together again as one united nation.

Thousands complain about about the long queue at the parliament house, but still appear at that solemn place awaiting to pay their last respect, simply because hours of waiting nothing compare to the enormous contributions you made. In that hours of waiting, we all had a feeling of familiarity towards each other although many of us had never might each other before. There was this amazing feeling of connection and bond Singaporeans had but never realized.

50 years ago, Mr Lee, you stood before us, all Singaporeans had a common goal, a better tomorrow.
50 years later, Mr Lee, you lie before us, all Singaporeans have a common goal, to send our deepest appreciation and respect to you.

Mr Lee, you are the soul of the Singapore Spirit, you are the blood of Singapore’s veins, you are the father of all Singaporeans.

Thank you Mr Lee, because of you I am proud to call myself a Singaporean.
Davidson Chee

I thank you. I thank you for your efforts to shape Singapore into what it is today. Your hard work has paved the way for physically challenged people like me to come to Singapore and study, enjoy good transport and access most of the places in Singapore.


I first visited Singapore in 2006 on a medical trip. I was highly impressed by the infrastructure, cleanliness, and most of all the safety of this country. I remember telling my dad and mom, ‘I would like to live here one day.’ Two years later, my dad was able to secure a job – his dream of serving children with special needs – as an educational therapist at the Dyslexia Association of Singapore (DAS). I was ecstatic. From then on in 2008 until now, 2015, I have enjoyed every single minute that I have lived in this country.

Me Lee’s legacy has given birth to a fine nation. As a visionary and a great leader, he has excelled in creating a nation that through his nurturing hands, prospered. Once again I thank you Mr. Lee.
Mohamed Zimnaan

Dear Mr Lee,
Your passing comes at a poignant time as I did my national service for the last time this week. I find myself looking back a lot over the various great things that you have done for us through the years and the legacy that you have left Singapore with.


As an early 80’s 3rd generation Singaporean, I am a very fortunate beneficiary of the Singapore system, one which is based firmly on meritocracy, clean government and most of all, guided and moulded by your astute vision and strong leadership. For that, I am very grateful to you.

Yes, I have sacrificed the best time of my youth for the nation through national service but all of these are minuscule and nothing compared to what you have done for Singapore. Without you, I am very sure that Singapore will not be even close to what it is today.

I have not had the privilege to meet with you in person but yet know you dearly through the various policies that you and your government had and have implemented which impact me through my life. I am sure this feeling is something that most of this nation shares with me. Since your passing, countless Singaporeans from all walks of life and foreign leaders unite and come together to pay their last respects to you. I am deeply touched and really feel proud to be a Singaporean. You have truly created and united a very unlikely group of multiple ethnicities, races, religion and language together to forge a nation, one that is very prosperous one in a single generation against all odds.

You are truly a titan amongst men and a constant beacon of light to all of us Singapore for the past 50 years.

Thank you Mr Lee. May you rest in peace.
Eugene Jang

Dear Mr Lee,
I always wanted to meet you, and imagined such meetings where I am just awed with your words and the confidence you had for Singapore. You were indeed our father, you took on the burden and assured us with your words, your eyes, your smile, that all will be well.


Today, I met you as you lie in state. I cannot believe that I will not be listening to your voice, and seeing you at NDP. I am ever grateful to you and your team, for building Singapore. I am grateful whenever I walk out of my nice home, to my safe streets and well-structured roads. I am grateful when I see the Singapore skyline, the parks, and our airport. I am grateful.

Today, I move from being just grateful. I want to take actions, and do my part to ensure that your spirit and passion for Singapore lives on. That I do my part to protect the Singapore that has been created, and to improve on it further.

The queue to the Parliament House showed that I am not alone. Fellow Singaporeans, young and old are equally spirited and have the will in them to uphold your legacy.

Mr Lee, in your life, you created a Singaporean Singapore. In your death, you reminded us of being united, as one people, for Singapore, for you.

Thank you Mr Lee. May you Rest in Peace.

With Love and Respect,
Rafidah Rahumathullah

Dear Mr Lee
We may be a small red dot & have no natural resources or hinterland to fall back on but time & again under your wise leadership, we managed to survive & overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges.

I trust that you are in a better place. May you rest in peace.

Thank you
Wong Chau Peng and Family

Mr Lee sir, thanks for giving us a good nation to live in. As Singaporeans we are well respected by other nationalities because you have instill the discipline in us to grow from young, adult and become a mature human being. Without your tough but well-made rules and regulations, most of the young would have directed their respective life in a wrong concept. One good rule which you conceptualize was to make men serve National Service and to understand the purpose being a Singaporean, why there is a need for everyone to play their role to defend our nation. I admire you as a leader for making this happen.


Today our entire nation moans as you left us. We will still stand strong to defend this swamp which you turned into a concrete slab though the systems you have placed throughout these years. You have foreseen what we need for the next 50 years and how Singapore will be in SG 100. Hence we will fear none. We will continue to move forward as one nation.

RIP Mr Lee Kuan Yew sir, our founding father.
Narenthiran

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yee,


Thank you for everything that you had done for Singapore!

I belong to the Millennials Generation, and because of you, I am able to live in a safe and secured environment with comfort, where I call home. Your belief in education and bilingualism will allow me to gain the upper hand when I step out into the industry in a few years time. With these, I am truly grateful to you.

A simple thank you will never be enough to repay your contributions to Singapore, but I believe by carrying on with your legacy and building a better Singapore will be the way to keep you proud.

I hope you are able to witness the bond between Singaporeans ‘as one united people, regardless of race, language or religion’ as we grief while keeping your spirit alive. I hope you’re proud of it and long may it continue.

Mr Lee Kuan Yew – A role model as a fighter, devoted husband and father, and the best prime minister.

May you reunite with your beloved wife, Mdm Kwa Geok Choo.
Gone but not forgotten, Rest in peace, Sir.

Dear Honorable Mr Lee Kuan Yew


I do not have enough words to express my heartfelt gratitude for what you have given us. You demonstrated courage, determination and compassion to build Singapore as it is today. We are nothing but the results of your sheer hardwork of a lifetime. Together with Mrs Lee, who stood by you in every decision and at every moment of your life, both of you have given us shelter we call home, education system to bring our country forward, clean water and a beautiful garden city. All this is made and created by you and your ideologies.

You gave world class infrastructure, a safe and secure home, equality and freedom to practice our culture and religion. You allowed us to speak our hearts and minds, but limited and restricted us, so that we do not hurt the sentiments of others. You took care of your citizens just like a family. You dedicated your entire life to build this nation. And i can only hope as Singaporeans, we put our best foot forward to uphold what the legacy you have left behind. You’re probably the last man of 21 Century who is deserving and worthy of all the respect of people and countries across continents. For generations to come, your stories will be told in many ways. History will remember you, Hearts will cherish you and future will respect you.

With all due respect, I salute you and wish you rest in peace. May you watch us from wherever you’re and feel proud of us in every way.

With Love and Respect,
Khusboo Kumari Pandery

I remember you as the affable man in white in his chauffeur driven car, smiling and waving to me and my friends as your car pulled alongside my mother’s at the Panggong Negara lights. My schoolmates and I were ecstatic. Even then, I knew who you were, but not quite. I understood more as I grew up and have always revered you as the man who gave Singapore the global respect and consideration it otherwise would not have received. Sure we all worked with you, do or die. You were a perfectionist who suffered no fools and we became like you, our founding father, who was always ready for a scrap. Through you, we can walk the world with our heads held high, proud of who we are and where we come from. We are welcomed everywhere we go because our reputation for orderliness, discipline, meritocracy and honesty precedes us. You were afraid that we might dismantle all that you’ve done, that we might not have the will and intellectual fortitude to do the right thing for Singapore. Well, you can rest now, on the assurance that your people have come out in their millions to tell you that they will not let you down. Wherever we may be in the world, we will carry our heritage with pride and work together to make Singapore a better place than when you left her. It was a pleasure knowing you even if it was for a fleeting moment. RIP Mr Lee.

Dear Mr. Lee Kuan Yew


When I heard you say that you had given your life to build a successful Singapore, I am very touched. Who is willing to give up his life for a cause such as this, if he does not care; do not believe at all and do not commit with his whole heart to persevere and work towards it, regardless of the cost and sacrifice he has to make.

I often wonder where and what I will be if I am not born in S’pore. I thank God that I am born in this nation especially when I see how blessed I am as compared to others. I am thankful that many people of your generation had contributed tremendously to the building of this nation that I can now call my home. It is my precious home indeed.

About our society, I am thankful that you have try to make us different, having and preserving good social and moral values. You want us to be a society with a big heart that cares for others. Thank you for the numerous self improved campaigns (that make Singapore so unique) and your strong emphasis on bilingualism. Thank you for being bold to implement them even when they attract criticism and grumblings because you believe it will be good for us at the end. Our society is definitely more cohesive and gracious now. And we can all have a good head start in life through exposure and good education provided for us, as long as we are willing to work hard. Thank you!

You are unique and I thank God for you. You have left your footprints in history. We will surely miss you!

Everyone is deeply saddened by Mr LKY’s departure. Although life and death is part and parcel of life, it still hurts big time and it’s tough to accept when it happens. Mr LKY is a great man, great leader, great husband and a great father to the whole nation. Without him, there will be no Singapore, no us and no place which we can all safely and comfortably call it home. Now that he has left us and resting in peace, he will not be forgotten. His contributions to the modern Singapore today will be remembered by all. As we mourn over the loss of this great man, we will stand united as SINGAPOREANS and further develop Singapore with his visions in mind. May you rest in peace.


Gone but never forgotten….
Halena Chua

Dear Sir,


We Singaporeans are mourning for the loss of you. For the past week my heart aches, throat tight and tears well up each time I see a report, article, picture or video of you…they are everywhere I go.

I have already known since I was little how much you have done to build Singapore into where we are today…I think somehow this has been ingrained in every Singaporean’s mind.

For the past week, I have learned much more of your many sacrifices, struggles, toils and contributions in developing Singapore, which I truly believe..with your best and only intention to give all Singaporeans a better tomorrow, a better life. I have also gained some insights into snippets of your daily life through interviews of your family, friends, staff and comrades. I have learned and touched by the soft side of you as a loving husband, caring father, thoughtful friend, demanding yet reasonable boss. I’m amazed by how simple and frugal personal lifestyle you have lived !

I especially admire your single-mindedness and courage to tiredlessly search and explore, consider and deliberate, decide, implement and see it through policies you think best for Singapore and its people, even though you knew that some may be unpopular policies. You knew that Singaporeans would realise and understand that this is best for us when result prove it. I think this kind of belief, spirit, attitude, determination and courage is what you hope for in the younger generation government, and that Singaporeans would continue to support and have faith in the present and future Singapore govt…I think this is one of your main concerns too.

I do have faith in the present govt, and I believe they would continue to do and give their best. So, thank you Sir, and rest in peace. You’re greatly, greatly missed.
Pearl Teo

Dear Sir,


A big bow and salute to you as a sign of my uttermost respect for who you are and what you have strived to make Singapore to be today. I am very blessed to be growing up during the times when you started out to ‘grow and develop’ our nation. You have set high standards for all Singaporeans to achieve and follow.

Though I now live abroad, I am always proud to say that I am a Singaporean and can hold my head high by what our nation has achieved. Though there were controversies in some of your policies and systems, we know that your intentions are always for the good of the nation. You were a man of integrity and you have lived your life standing by what you believed in and I truly respect you for that. As one who grew up and educated in Singapore, I am proud to say that some of the values that you have instilled in us as a nation are still the ones I have taken on as my values – to work hard and to achieve to a high standard of my abilities.

Your demise has stirred in deep emotions within me. As a nation, we are saddened by your passing. But I can truly congratulate you on the passions you have in this life on earth – a celebration of a life well lived; one of which is Singapore, and the other, your beloved wife and family, both of which you have succeeded in growing and loving.

Thank you for being such a great example to us as our founding father. My prayer is that Singapore’s current and future leaders will continue in your legacy to grow and ‘love’ Singapore with the integrity and steadfastness you have left behind. Both acts are certainly tough acts to follow.

Thank you also for the multiculturalism identity you have made Singapore to be which has enabled Singaporeans to be more tolerant of people of other races. This trait is definitely unique to Singapore and not many countries have this to show for.

To end this tribute, I would also like to extend my deepest condolences to Mr Lee Hsien Loong and the whole family for the loss of a loved one.

Let us all continue to pray for this nation that one man had set out to mould and grow into what it is today – a well known city all over the world.

‘Let all supplications, prayers, intercessions and thanksgivings be made for all people (of Singapore) , for kings (PM, Cabinet Ministers and leaders) and all who are in high positions, that we (Singapore) may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way.’ 1 Timothy 2:1-2

You are like the man as described in the Book of Proverbs 28:2 – ‘When a land transgresses, it has many rulers, but with a man of understanding and knowledge, its stability will long continue.’

May Singapore’s stability continue to reign with the legacy you left to your successors.

Rest in peace, Sir, You will always have a special place in my heart!

Love,
Suzanne Yap

Dear Mr Lee,

On May 13, 1969, when racial riots broke out in Malaysia, I was four years old. My parents were in Chow Kit Road, the scene of the heaviest rioting. They fled for their lives and, miraculously, escaped unscathed. Shaken, they moved my siblings and I, all five of us, the youngest barely a year old, to Singapore under the care of a guardian, while they remained in Malaysia. It was a tough but well-considered decision. And one they have never regretted.

Time and again, you would be the topic of conversation at dinner time in our household. My parents, in particular, were always full of praise for you. You were singular; a man of your time and beyond.

I am 50 this year. Singapore has been home to me for over 40 years. I married a Singaporean and have 3 children. You would be smiling approvingly if you were still around. Truth be told, there’s no better place in the world than Singapore to raise a family.

I just spent a short three grateful seconds gazing where you lay in Parliament House, bowing and uttering a short prayer. And then had to move on as thousands were waiting to do the same. It felt insufficient given the magnitude of your sacrifice.

On the way home, I overheard a little girl singing her version of “”Majulah Singapura””: “”Mari kita yaya Singapura, macam macam ma guru…”” I smiled, something I could not do much of in the past few days. I am certain she had no clue what she was singing about. But how befitting.

Indeed, “”onward proud Singapore, like a teacher…”” to many cities around the world with our model of sustainable and inclusive development.

Mr Lee, Singapore owes you an incalculable debt. We will always honour the memory of you and celebrate your life, one which you lived completely devoted to building this nation.

Rest in peace, Mr Lee.
Lorinne Kon

Go forward! Your Honour, your wise words are aplenty, but to me, after “”Merdeka””, Your exhortation to us to forge ahead relentlessly as the ONLY way for Singapore to survive and prosper will forever me etched in my mind. It took me many years to understand the true meaning of this word in our National Anthem and I will always remember it. Rest In Peace, your Honour, for we shall be eternally grateful for all that you have done for Singapore, and we shall keep on forging forward! Thank you, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

Wong Soon Hong

Dear Mr Lee,
Your legacy and achievements are for all to see.
You are not only a great statesman, but also a faithful husband, a devoted father and a doting grandfather. What else can we ask from a man like this.


We as Singaporean, are forever grateful to what you have given us and words cannot explain how sad I was when I heard this news. Would love to have you around to celebrate the jubilee year with us but unfortunately, it wasn’t to be.

I was there at SGH last Sunday (22 Mar 2015) to pen my well wishes just before you passes on. I remembered that there was a heavy downpour of rain throughout the whole island and today, during the final send off, it happened again. Maybe it was a coincidence or maybe it was not.

Nevertheless, you have devoted your whole life to build a solid foundation for our future generation and I am sure that the only way to go for Singapore is up.

The citizens have spoken, Mr Lee.
Rest in peace.
Majulah Singapura
Yah Dihao & Family

Dear Sir,

I was planning to drop by Parliament House to pay my last respects or join my parents at the CC yesterday to pen my message, but decided not to as I know I’ll be standing at one of the tables, thinking hard on what i should write. Even as i type this message now, I’m not sure how i am going to start as there are many thoughts running through my head – so here goes.

Growing up, I resented the education policies you made – such as Bilingualism. I hated attending language classes at school, for the teachers taught the language by asking us to memorise the words for 听写，造句. While others excelled at memorising, I was bad at it – I only understood the beauty of my mother tongue and English after I left Secondary School, where I learnt the language slowly at my own pace and by understanding the meaning behind the words used. My creative side was not an advantage during my childhood and teenage years, as it was a stable route to go into business, sciences than the arts in Singapore. As my grandpa would put it, artists only become profitable after they passed away. While majority benefited from the Singapore Education System and Meritocracy, I had a bumpy ride with it.

It’s been years since then, I am now a developer at a small local enterprise – where I can tap into my creative side when providing solutions for my clients. I don’t hate you for what you have done as it must have been hard having to decide the livelihood of the entire nation. Thank you for the contributions and sacrifices you made for Singapore, along with the old guards.

Say hello to my grandpa over at the other side, he’s a fan of yours. : )

We are all shocked and saddened by the departure of our great founding father, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. He was a fantastic man, he gave his life unconditionally to the people of Singapore, and to the world. It is a terrible lost to us, as a nation up shaped by him and his comrades.


Despite his heavy criticisms from his opponents, Mr Lee was a successful firm man of his words. Not many were like him – what he dare to say, he dare to act. He was a man of his words. That what brings him about to be the best blessings to us as a small nation of Singapore. We owe him much that we all live in such comfortable homes and lives. He has brought Singapore from third world to first, where we were respected by the world.

Not only is he a fellow country man of all times, but we do see him as a worthy good example, of a family man. He has his soft side which touches the heart of many.

Mr Lee, Thank you for giving so much to our nation, and your endless selfless giving. We, the citizens of Singapore, and the people of thr world will miss you very much.

May you rest in peace.

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


Our nation will forever be in your debt for your great vision-to turn a fishing village into a metropolis, perserverance-against all odds and opposition, courage-in tumultous times, unparalled love-the greatest any man can have for their country and passion-relentless desire for Singapore to succeed.
All the sacrifices you made and the dedication of your entire adult life so that we may all have a roof over our heads, food in our stomachs, education and employment to ensure our continued survival and to be able to have and do all with peace of mind is the legacy you have left. Exactly as your son, our Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said,””There will NOT be another Mr Lee Kuan Yew””. I cannot agree more.

I believe all of Singapore and Singaporeans share my sentiments and join me in honouring you with greatest respect. Thank you Mr Lee for having gone beyond your duty and leaving us with a country we are so proud to be a part of.

May you rest in peace and be forever united with your beloved wife.

With deepest gratitude and respect,
Fiona KE E-Ling

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


Thank you for the years of relentless striving to better the life of all Singaporeans. You stood tall on the world stage and made your fellow citizens proud, that there is someone from our midst willing to take on the world for our sake. Your clear unwavering positions including that of clean government and meritocracy enabled everyone including someone like me to advance in life in a way that would not have been possible otherwise.

The nation mourns your loss and you will be sorely missed. Going forward we can only build upon your legacy as one people, one nation, one Singapore.
Rachel Lim

I had never given much thought to the history of Singapore for the past years that I have lived. I thought, “”Singapore’s history does not have much to say. After all, we only have 49 years of history to speak about. That definitely isn’t much as compared to the other countries around the world.”” Unfortunately, only after the passing of the respected Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, has realisation hit me like a 200 pound sledgehammer. Singapore’s history, although short, was one extremely well crafted by the late Mr Lee.
Sure, I definitely knew that many people respected the late Mr Lee but I never knew to what extent and for what reasons. For that, I am extremely ashamed of myself to not have bothered about my own country’s state affairs. Whatever had happened or whatever will happen, didn’t matter to me at all. For me, all I wanted was to study hard then think of a possible immigration to other countries in the future. Or rather, my future. Singapore, was simply a ‘stepping stone’ towards one of my future aspirations. Complaining about the many aspects of Singapore was, like many other Singaporeans, “my favourite hobby”. But recently, the sorrow from all around the world, the 24-hour long queues of people standing outdoors waiting for as long as 8 hours to pay tribute to him, great testimonials from many and how he lived his life, etc. Screamed only one thing. Mr Lee Kuan Yew has touched the hearts of many.
Since the passing of noble Mr Lee on the 23rd of March 2015, people from all around the world have been mourning for him and articles on his noble contributions were being passed around and were everywhere. Important political figures worldwide remembers him as a good friend and a role model. The media and all the commemoration was how I got to know more on about his great doings when he lived.
The charismatic Mr Lee, had lived a long life and had worked his hardest for us every single day since the age of 41. He was diligent and focused in his responsibilities towards Singapore, and everything he did every single day were contributions towards Singapore, whether big or small. He had a vision for Singapore and with courage, he stepped out and shouldered the heavy responsibility, which many viewed as a burden while he did not, of bringing Singapore from a land with nothing to a land that prospers. He had attributed the whole of his life to the building of Singapore from nothing to something. He has given us a home, and a national identity that is extremely worthy to be proud of. He had led us to where we are now. If only we knew about the details on what he done earlier and if only his doings were spoken about widely and shared earlier. It would be less of a heartache for many like me. However so, I fully respect the humility of the late Mr Lee when he lived.
This year Singapore celebrates its jubilee year, commemorating the almost-a-miracle building of the Singapore nation. In the celebration of our past 50 years of achievements, we will again, remember our main catalyst Mr. Lee who drove us hard to where we are today, achieving so much in such a short time. After which, our people with the gratitude etched on our minds and the legacy that lives in our hearts, will work harder than ever, sprinting towards the goal that Mr. Lee has set for the future of Singapore in many years to come. We as the citizens of Singapore, will pledge ourselves to build on the foundations of our pioneer generation, to work as one united people, to build a democratic, justified and equated society to achieve happiness, further prosperity and continual progress for our very own nation in which we call home. 50 years does not simply mark our end.
Thank you Mr Lee Kuan Yew for all that you have done. Thank you for aspiring the Singapore now, then. And finally, thank you, for allowing me to be part of the creation that you and your people have worked so hard for.
I believe, our generation will now feel more than honoured to serve the Singapore Nation. Your teachings will be greatly remembered and may you rest in peace now that you have ascended to heaven, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

On remembering..


It was a cosy time hearing stories from aunties and uncles about vicious gang fights, race riots and curfews in 1970s Singapore. When it was our turn, we glanced at each other. We are one of the youngest in the group and had not experienced how Singapore was pre-independence. But the late MM Lee’s influence on us as civil servants is indelible.

The husband shared that when he went on official overseas trips, he had come across foreigners who ask him “”what made you join the public service?”” They were genuinely puzzled that one would prefer the public sector over the private. As the conversation wore on, he realised that for some countries, government officials were highly distrusted. They also shared that in their country, the path was chosen primarily for monetary gains. I am thankful that the late MM Lee had built a system of governance with intolerance for corruption. Today, monetary reasons as the main motivation for entering the civil service is not common.

The past 5 days of reflection on the late MM’s actions and dedication to the country struck a chord in me. Since stepping into public service, MM’s style has somehow been imbued in my work ethos. The spirit of excellence, the need to think through all angles, the imperative to account to tax-payers, the discipline to write simply and clearly, are some examples of the late MM’s influence permeating through the voices of bosses over the years. This morning I had a laugh when I read the newspapers. A lady had written about how MM inspected the toilet before an opening ceremony. It resonated with me. In the few events I had to organise, I was also taught to make sure that the toilets were clean and had sufficient toilet rolls. In reading the many stories about MM, I have come to understand that similar good practices ingrained in the civil service are mostly attributable to him.

There is much more to be thankful for and we pray that the future generations to come will not forget what MM’s legacy has taught us.

I was born here in 1964. I grew up in those difficult times when you, and your team, struggled to build our nation.
Today, my life is comfortable. I had a decent education, have a decent job and managed to build a home here. These were achieved, no doubt, in some ways through my own efforts.
But it was only possible because of the foundations that you, and your team, had laid down for us.
For it was your leadership and your team’s effort that have transformed this little Red Dot to what Singapore is today.
For that, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, sir, I am thankful and grateful. I am living comfortably on the legacy that you have left us.
Thank you.
And to me, sir, you have never left us. You have left us your wisdom, love, passion, beliefs and so much more which can be seen & felt every where on this little Red Dot.
To me, you are Singapore.


Yours faithfully,
S. Hoon

In yesterday’s Special Parliamentary Sitting to pay tribute to the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Minister Ng Eng Hen recounted this of Mr Lee: In 1968, an MP asked in Parliament, how the British withdrawal would impact Singapore. Mr Lee told Singaporeans plainly that the British bases made up 20 per cent of the GNP and tens of thousands of jobs would be lost. To overcome this drastic impact, Singaporeans would have “to adapt and adjust, without any whimpering or wringing of hands, as a way of life which they have been accustomed to over 30 years comes to an end”. When another MP followed and asked if economic aid from the British could ease the effects of the pull-out, Mr Lee’s quick and unequivocal rejoinder was that any aid should “”not make us dependent on perpetual injections of aid from the outside””, that “”…we cannot change our attitude to life, that the world does not owe us a living and that we cannot live by the begging bowl. The best way of meeting the problem is to go about it quietly and intelligently discussing our problems in a low key and with as little fuss and bother as possible.””


It is clear that Singapore would not have come this far without Mr Lee’s brilliant and decisive leadership. Mr Lee was a tough man, and he brought the country through tough times. As a child of the 80’s, I have grown up in relative peace and prosperity as compared to those before my time. The Singapore River was already clean and flanked by gleaming skyscrapers, and Singapore, with its gushing Merlion, had made it as a First World country that many in the region were envious (and some might say, jealous) of. In school, we were constantly reminded that we should not rest on the laurels of those before us, and that we should continue to work hard to progress our nation. Singapore has come this far by being stoic and pragmatic and industrious, and we should not lose these values.

We are still today, a young nation and even as we remember the achievements that have been accomplished by those before us, more importantly we should remember that hardships can come in different forms. It is wise that we do not become complacent nor divisive, and continue to stand united as a one people to weather through thick and thin. Mr Lee shall remain always a great inspiration for my generation and generations to come.
Lee Hui Ying, SLNG

We Singaporeans are blessed to have had such a great leader. We will not be where we are today without him. He fought for us and spent his life building a successful Singapore. Everything he did and every decision he made, was for the good of Singapore and its people. He left behind a huge legacy, and we will continue to build on what he left for us. Thank you so much Mr Lee Kuan Yew!!
Ang Pei Pei, SLNG

A day that will undoubtedly leave an inedible mark on our lives. I was deeply saddened and no words could utter the feeling of waking up with the news for the passing of a great leader, the founding Father of Singapore – Mr Lee Kuan Yew. I believe people all around the world are as well grieving over the loss of a remarkable, brilliant leader. My heartfelt condolences to the family and citizens of Singapore.


This week marks a sombre and reflective week for Singapore and many others. I wasn’t part of the generation who lived through the historical transition; neither am I a Singaporean, nor I know Mr Lee in person; I don’t know much about him and the history but the feeling of dolefulness however is overwhelming, that, even photos and news feeds on social medias could make me tear. Words can’t adequately express how I feel and the gratitude for what you have done for your nation.

My heart has been deeply saddened by your loss and touched by your hard works and passion and building a nation. Through the countless articles, speeches, eulogies that I have came across over the week shown me that you are indeed a great leader, a great father of nation, a great husband and as well a great man.

Mr Lee, you were a man with word, never an empty promise. Your love for the nation and the family touches me deep down. My million thank and gratitude isn’t enough for the tangible evidence of your hard work that has benefited me directly and for the values that you have held throughout your life. Without you, Mr Lee, I wouldn’t be stepping on a city with great education and people. Without you, I wouldn’t be fulfilling my dream and aspiration over at the city you have built. I want to say thank you for being supportive of foreign students studying over here; our safety, opportunities, comfortable life and many many more.

The heavens cry as the nation mourns. Here comes the point where we have to bid goodbye. Without you, Singapore would not be where she is today. You have lived through to see your hard work to fruition and your legacy will continue. You will be greatly missed but will forever live in our hearts. Thank you Mr Lee, may you rest in peace.
Jasmine Goh

They say history is made by great men and I truly believe so. Mr Lee rose amongst common men during the early tumultuous years of Singapore’s independence and shouldered a nation’s hopes and dreams. He led the nation to her success through his wisdom, foresight, grit and a deep conviction to better the lives of fellow Singaporeans. Today, we mourn the passing of a great man. But, we seek comfort that his name shall forever be engraved in the history of Singapore. His vision shall be propagated by every Singaporean. Thank you Sir, for everything you have done for us all.
Lim Bing Yao, SLNG

It was your vision and leadership that led to the success which Singapore enjoys today. You have left Words will not suffice to express our gratitude. Even as we grieve, the outpouring of heartfelt community spirit in the Padang queue, as one united people, stands testament to your life’s achievements. We are indeed blessed to have had you as the founding Prime Minister. I salute you Sir, for your unwavering love for your wife and selfless passion for Singapore. Thank you Mr Lee.

Tribute to our founding father Mr Lee Kuan Yew


1923-2015

You are indeed profoundly intelligent, compellingly articulate and obsessively passionate legacy world class leader as they said.

You fought hard to lead Singapore out of a turbulent and uncertain era and shaped her into a first world country.

We can never find another great man like you. You have dedicated your entire life with selfless sacrifice and protected our country with all your heart & soul. Your tremendous contributions and perseverance has made this little red dot roar like a lion and made significant influence to the world.

I pray that our nation will continue to build on the invaluable foundation that you have laid for us and make Singapore a better place where we call home. Without you, we wouldn’t be enjoying a safe, clean, green and efficient first world garden city.

THANK YOU for not giving up on us! You will always remain in our hearts. You have made us proud. I am proud to call myself a Singaporean!

I salute you with highest honour & respect

Your fellow Singaporean.
Ivy

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


You have inspired a nation. You have given us hope. You have taught us important virtues such as hard work, determination, honesty, integrity and respect. Most of all, you have built Singapore to be a place where all Singaporeans have the opportunities to excel and maximise their fullest potential, regardless of our social economic background. For all that you have done for Singapore, we THANK YOU.
John Ng, CEO of Singapore LNG Corporation

“ A public figure, yet a very private man.


We all think we knew Mr Lee, having listened to him speak, scold, demand, guide, stare and point but few have known him for who he really is. Mr Lee was only doing his job. I have disagreed and even been angry with him for being so ‘strict’. Again Mr Lee was only doing his job. Mr Lee took his job very seriously and, one he had dedicated his whole life to.

Today we all get to know Mr Lee for who he really is. Mr Lee cared. Mr Lee cared about everyone and everything. That is how Singapore came about, because everyone and everything mattered.

A man with a golden heart and an intelligent mind. Singapore is so lucky to have Mr Lee guide us through the tough times and laid the foundation for generations to come.

I am 39 this year and growing up, Mr Lee is invincible. Mr Lee was unbeatable. Never wavered and never gave in. Few have such a strong mind. Mr Lee took punches from the very people he cared for and work so hard to provide for. But Mr Lee stayed firm in his belief and for that, we are now the Singapore that we are.

Deeply saddened, eternally grateful. We have no fear knowing this day has come and you are no longer physically with us for you have thought us to be strong individuals, with integrity and confidence, we are ready to take on new challenges the world will continue to face.

Deepest condolences to your family, especially to Mr Lee Hsien Long, who despite his grief, has to carry out his duties as a Prime Minister. Just like you would have done so.

Rest now and be assured that Singapore will sail forth with pride and confidence.

Thank you, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

A proud Singaporean, Grace ..

A everlasting tribute to our Singapore’s legendary founder and 1st Prime Minister.


Dear Mr Lee,

Your profound wisdom, teachings, and governing efficiency have made our little “”red dot”” country elevated to significant world stage. We thank you most profoundly.

I have travelled to many places in the world and the minute I identified myself as a Singaporean, the next comments I received was “”Your country very clean, beautiful, very efficient and you have a great stable Government under Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew””. Everybody knew about Singapore through Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s effective leadership and he was looked upon as a great communicator who had delivered his talks which today were transparent in the Legacy he had left behind to everybody.

Mr Lee Kuan Yew connected Singapore’s businesses with the world and have never waivered from his visionary goal to aim for national economic achievement. Thank you once again.

To list the achievements of Mr Lee Kuan Yew are as boundless as the “”stars in the sky””.

Inspiration from books and past speeches of Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s eternal fountain of wisdom will be the greatest motivation for all to emulate.

Thank you Mr Lee Kuan Yew for your Legacy to Singaporeans and we will miss YOU, the most impressive, intellectual and practical leader of this century.

Rest in Peace and I am confident Singapore’s leaders will carry on your marathon torch and will lead Singapore to a very bright future.

Sending sincere condolences to Mr Lee Hsien Loong & family at this sad time.

Yours sincerely,
Rita Ng Lai Ling

To Mr Lee Kwan Yew – with the inevitable finally coming to pass, I thank you for being such an inspiration over the years I have lived in Singapore.


When I first came to live here, and discovered your profound words and actions that wrote the course of history over five decades, my subsequent years on this island would become a time to really sit up and continually contemplate life’s important questions, and thanks to you, this period undoubtedly helped shape my world view.

More recently, my family discovered that my long lost grandfather served in Singapore during WW2 and was made POW somewhere near Holland Village in 1942. This was something many families had to endure, and indeed hugely significant to you Mr Lee, who was also captured during that time.

With such massive struggle over the years, your boundless passion for life, such dedication to your wife, and an unmistakable frankness to saying what you felt needed to be said remains your inspiring trademark attribute.

Although I never met Mr Lee, I had the privilege of working on one of his tribute films and so hope my very small contribution to honouring his life will play a part in remembering one of the world’s most remarkable human beings.

Rest in peace Mr Lee Kwan Yew – 1923 to 2015
Emile Guertin

At a young age, I believe that Mr Lee has fought for the nation, succeeding in growing Singapore as what it is today. His people, respect him, look up to him and support his decision. I may not have witness major contributions done by him but I always believe that his actions were right and best for Singapore.
His values became meaningful to me – to be a good listener and aim for higher level of education. Thanks to him, we have a higher quality of life and better living environment.
On behalf of my grandmother, who has been a big fan of Mr Lee Kwan Yew, I pray for him to rest in peace and proceed to the next stage of life.
Thank you Mr Lee. Thank you for your greatest effort for Singapore. Thank you for motivating and having faith in your people. May you rest in peace and we will all remember you, your kindness and your rights. The light and brightness of Singapore, as what is represented in your name.
Wendy

Dear Mr. Lee,


Thank you for all your hard work building this nation. I never knew the amount of dedication you put in and the hardships you went through until I saw the tributes and documentaries after your passing.

From the number of people who turned up to pay their respects to the foreign VIPs who flew in, there’s no doubt you have touched their lives in one way or another. May present and future generation continue to honor you and build on the foundation that you and your team have laid.

Once again thank you and may God continue to bless your family.

Bernard Tham

Dear Mr Lee


Thank you for all that you have done for Singapore. You have developed Singapore, putting in so much hard work for the nation. You helped us create reservoirs so that we have sufficient water every day. You provided us with good and proper education.
You did not give up on Singapore despite challenges, instead you continued to figure out better ways to develop Singapore. Thank you for having the perseverance. You made sure Singapore did not have riots and also built HDB flats for us to live in because you were worried about our safety. You maintained the clean policy of Singapore, by taking the initiative to sweep the floors.
Words cannot describe my gratitude for what you have done for us.
Cheng Zhi Tong

Tribute to Mr Lee Kuan Yew


When I was a boy, I was suddenly ushered out of the cinema midway through a movie. Outside, I saw police waving batons moving the people away to go home. Curfew followed shortly due to a racial riot between Malays and Chinese.

I experienced two occasions of massive flooding in the ‘60s. I was living on the ground floor of a shop house. People waded in dirty floodwaters above their knees.

These are images of Singapore in the past. We no longer have to struggle through such unpleasant times. Thanks to the strong, dedicated and visionary leadership of Mr Lee Kuan Yew and the efforts of his team. In a short period of just 50 years, Singapore has been transformed. We enjoy racial harmony; we have active, beautiful and clean waterways, and greenery around our ever dense but pleasant built-up and buzzing urban landscape.

I am deeply saddened at the death of our founding father, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Mr Lee has left behind a large legacy for us. He has dedicated his life to make Singapore what it is today. In fact, watching and reading the tributes and condolence messages penned by world leaders, my heart is overwhelmed with pride that his influence and contributions have gone far beyond the shores of Singapore, the little red dot. I am proud that he is more than equal among the great leaders of the modern world. His worldview and the philosophy that he embraced and shared have benefited many world leaders and their countries too.

I have fond memory of my only encounter with Mr Lee, then Prime Minister. I met him in person when I was a young architect in PWD working on the refurbishment of the City Hall building in 1988. He dropped in unannounced to look at the project. He came alone (no big party accompanying) and I was alone too as my senior architect could not arrive in time. I showed him around some of the work in progress. He surprised me with his great attention to details, asking questions about the building materials used, their origin and costs.

His passing is a great loss to Singapore, but we have much to gain from him. He has made us proud to be Singaporeans. We have a beautiful and safe place to call home. I am grateful for his selfless dedication for Singapore. Most grateful is that he instituted a system of peaceful and smooth succession of political leadership. It can ensure that what he tirelessly built will last. It gives us a strong resolve to continue his values and aspirations for an even better Singapore.

Thank you most deeply, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

Dear PM Lee Hsien Loong,
My deepest condolences to you and your family. My prayers are with you and your family members. I thank God for giving us such an honourable man of great intellect and astute leadership, and yet humble and personable, at a time when Singapore needed most. May God grant you peace and comfort during this time of bereavement and continue to bless you and your team with strength and wisdom as you lead Singapore beyond SG50.
Yip Kim Seng

Dear Mr Lee,
I have read all your books and was always intrigued by your work for Singapore, but never in my 38 years have I felt this way as I do now having to immerse myself into your world with the flood of TV recordings, speeches and photographs. What struck me was a devotion and discipline to family and nation that provides the deep foundation that drives you. I have been privileged in my career to have met and worked with some esteemed men this world has seen. I have been inspired by some of them no less share some of the traits I see in you as well.


This week, you have provided me a valuable lesson in life. This week, I have begun to cherish my family and nation in a very different but assuring way. This week, I have through your passing become inspired to not just think about our country but what I can do for it. The noise and sound this week are but noise and whilst I know many of us appreciate and are grateful to you, I hope that this does change the complacency I see and allow us not to forget the true cause of your work.

You have loved this country so much because we call this home. We face no suppression today, only our own, in such shallow thoughts when I want an equally good opportunity for my children. And I care too much as you did for your fellow citizens.

Sir, thank you for what you have done. You have laid the foundation and conditions for many of us to continue the flame of hardworking, diligent, thoughtful and passionate spirit and I hope I will be able to do my small part in making you equally proud of us all.

Gratefully and respectfully, Adrian

Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


Thank you for all that you have done for Singapore. We would not be where we are today without your leadership, perseverance and foresight. The whole of Singapore as one, mourns for your passing on, but the whole of Singapore as one, also celebrates your life.

At last year’s national day when I saw you for a brief moment on national television, my heart filled with so much thankfulness and respect for you, and I stood up and clapped for you, the one who gave your entire life for this nation of Singapore. You looked like you aged a lot and I remember telling my family that I hoped so much that you would be able to witness Singapore’s 50th birthday this August. When I heard news that you passed away, my heart was very saddened. This year’s national day (and the rest to come) wouldn’t ever be the same again without your presence.

I feel also very sad that I am overseas now and unable to physically be with my fellow Singaporeans in Singapore during this significant time in the history of Singapore. I wish I was now in Singapore, watching Singapore news and flipping through the newspapers reading stories about your life, and paying my last respects to you. Being away from Singapore at this time makes me realise how much Singapore means to me, as my home and my country, and how much I respect you for all that you have done. My friends and family back home have been sending me short clips of the state funeral and pictures of newspaper articles of how Singapore is remembering you during this time. As I looked through the videos and newspapers, I am heartened to see how Singaporeans have put aside all their differences and have united as one to mourn for your passing.

I’m penning this e-tribute for you, from the land of Nepal, to say thank you. I would not be where I am today if not for your love and dedication to our nation.

You will always be remembered, by me, by Singapore, by the world.
Sherlyn Ang

Dear Mr Lee,


I would like to thank you for all that you have done for us, Singaporean. Your big vision, wisdom, determination and perseverance bring good life to Singaporean. It is fortunate to be born in this safe, clean and comfortable Singapore and I am always so proud to be a Singaporean. Without you, all these wouldn’t have been possible.

I will remember your fighting spirit, treasure the legacy you left us and play my part as a Singapore citizen to build upon this legacy to make Singapore even a better home in many generations to come.

You will be dearly missed and remembered in our heart always. You worked very hard your entire life for us, Singaporean, for a better life, please rest well now and may you rest in peace.

Thanks again.

This is from one of my favorite authors: “Everyone must leave something behind when he dies, my grandfather said. A child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes made. Or a garden planted. Something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die, and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted, you’re there.


It doesn’t matter what you do, he said, so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something that’s like you after you take your hands away. The difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching, he said. The lawn-cutter might just as well not have been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime.”
― Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451

You’re the gardener, sir. May your legacy live on forever.

Juria Toramae

Dear Mr Lee,


In your passing, I give thanks to you and your team for laying the foundation of this republic. I like to highlight areas deserving praise.

In education, many have been uplifted out of poverty. Education is key to the thinking man. Without the capacity to read and learn, a man is doomed to ignorance. The key to controlling a population is depriving them of education, but you have done the opposite. You have given the populace the key to free themselves, opening up for many to have good jobs and exploring the world. The critics of today is also a product of this education. Without education, many would never even learn to question.

In housing, the modest HDB flat is testimony of good public housing. Many have benefited from a roof over the head, electricity, sanitation and clean water. Many of us take these comforts for granted, failing to acknowledge that these are the results of good governance.

No critic can take away the fact that Singapore is what it is today because of you and your team. You have made Singapore bigger than what it seems.

Thank you, Mr Lee, and may the republic lives on.

Lor

“ Dear Sir,


We are really thankful to you for what you have done for this country. We are enjoying the fruits of your hard work. Your life will always remain inspiration for generations to come.
We will progress and preserve what you have given to us.

Thanks from bottom of our heart. Rest in peace. You will always remain in our hearts.
Medha

Dearest Mr Lee,


Thank you for the numerous contributions and decisions which made Singapore leaped from a 3rd world country to a 1st world country. During this week of mourning, TV has been showing the past Mr Lee Kuan Yew success, it was good for the young generations as they were not born at the time when Singapore has fought for it’s independence. It was then also made known to me that Mr Lee’s contribution and his vision foresight were very accurate and was at all best interest for Singapore. Without fighting independence (Merdeka) in 1965, Singapore will not be a country of itself.
Now, Singapore is no longer a small dot, it is a country full of hopes and I am proud to call it home. This 50 years of transformation made Singapore bloom into a 1st world country where it is clean and green.
No words can express my gratitude, respect, appreciation for you, Mr Lee. Without you, there will never be a Singapore like today.
Thank you Mr Lee for everything.

Prayers to PM Lee and his family,
May Mr Lee Kuan Yew rest in peace.
Alvin

Singapore is my home and forever will be. I’m proud to be called Singaporean. I served my country with all my pride and give my all to this country. Why? Cause of you Sir.


You have made Singapore your life and you made Singapore what it is today. Without your hard work, vision and undying love to unite the people of Singapore, it will be a very different Singapore. As the pledge goes, regardless of race, language or religion, no country comes close to Singapore in terms of living harmoniously and cohesively despite our differences. People can wander in the street late at night and not worrying about their safety. And among your endless and unspoken contributions to Singapore, i truly am grateful for the safe, peaceful, corruption free, well maintained, beautiful garden city that i call Home. No matter how long i am posted overseas for work, i still miss Singapore. Thank you Mr Lee Kuan Yew for everything.

May you Rest in Peace knowing that you have done everything that you could for us.
Lots of Love, Airil, Shereen & Audrina Seet

Dear Mr Lee,


I can never thank you enough for giving us a wonderful Home.. A place that is safe and loving … A place where we are given the opportunity to be educated, to learn and to be ourselves.,, Most importantly, a place to call our own..

Without your unwavering and unconditional efforts and contributions, this wouldn’t be possible.., I’m really ever grateful from deep inside me for all the things you have done for us. Instead of enjoying the fruits of your labour with us, you left us ….there’s no Home without you. You are the Father of this Home you have built. Like any Father, you are always here to protect and shield us from any harm and danger…

It’s sad to say goodbye…your presence will be dearly missed.. You’ll always stay in our hearts and memories… May you rest in peace, Founding Father.,,,

您辛苦了，一路走好，安息吧！
永远怀念您！
With respect, Fong 28 March 2015

Dear Sir,


I was overwhelmed with emotions and unspeakable gratitude towards you, as I walked with thousands of grieving citizens to pay our final respects. I was born in during the period of time when the Mass Rapid Transit project was built, according to my mother. Even though I was not in the era when there was social turbulence, unrest and the implementation of contentious policies, and how things slowly settled down, I was able to witness how the town I am living in, slowly rose into a busy urban site from bare empty grass lands.

Sir, you have spent the entire life, crafting this powerful nation, and upon your passing, brought all Singaporeans closer together. A visionary statesman you are, with powerful instinct, foresight, impeccable ideals and planning, intelligence and wisdom, leading Singapore to the state she is now, and your sacrifices enabled all of us to enjoy the fruits of your labour.

Countless of “”Thank you”” will never be enough to express our gratitude towards what you have done. May Singapore continue to strive, together with us, Singaporeans. Have a rest well deserved, Sir. Rest in peace. We will continue to do you proud.
Aerieath Seng

I am truly blessed and proud to be a Singaporean.
As a youth, I’d only appreciated being a Singaporean as much as my cognition takes me. My pride as a Singaporean was derived from the text in Civics Education. My pride was cognitive.


As a working adult and having worked overseas, appreciation and pride grew from cognition to affection. The appreciation of what I used to take for granted, the law and order, the stability, the development and foresight of our leaders. The praises my foreign friends and associates sing of Singapore elevated my pride. My pride was affective.

As a Singaporean, this week, with the passing of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the term ‘Singaporean’ took on a different meaning. What we are known for : disciplined, hardworking, uncorrupt, etc, were not incidental. These traits were the results of well-planned and thoroughly thought through policies.

This week, Singaporeans showed togetherness, appreciation, gratitude, respect, civic-mindedness.
My pride as a Singaporean was emotive.

As an educator, I will strive impart values to nurture good and useful citizens, to inculate the national identity, to carry on the legacy and to continue to make Singapore a better home. My purpose is clear.

And now, my pride as a Singaporean is instinctive.
I stand with my head held high, I AM SINGAPOREAN.

Thank you, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
Christina Chang KH

Dear Mr Lee,


Thank you for everything you have done for Singapore. You have spent almost your whole life, with unwavering dedication and hard work to build up Singapore to what she is today. Singapore is very fortunate to have you as our 1st PM during the early years.

As more stories of you start to emerge on news & social media, you have gained many more Singaporeans’ respect & admiration, especially from the younger generation who are very fortunate to enjoy the fruits of your labour. We also start to learn more about you, about your frugality & your love for your family & your people. You are even admired & respected overseas.

Mr Lee, you are a good role model for us to follow. You will always be fondly remembered in every Singaporeans’ heart & in future generations to come as a great founding father.
With love & gratitude, Charlotte Neo

Dear Mr Lee,


Thank you for very much for your contribution to building Singapore from a small fishing village into a first world country. Without you, we are not even a dot, but because of your great contribution, we are now a small red dot which shines like a red ruby among a cup of pure crystal.

I live in the time when you are the PM of Singapore. I watch most telecast of your speech. I look forward to your speech each time they were delivered. Although I might not fully understand, I enjoy watching you over TV.

Our day starts with a fresh gush of tap water, which is so clean and conveniently available from home tap. We stay in a safe and secure flat. We open the windows and we see a garden of green, we breathe fresher air.

When it’s time for children to school, public buses are easily available across the overhead bridge. We do not need to walk in mud like those days in kampung.

The children are bilingualists, although I hope they could pick up dialect as well. At this point, they speak English and Mandarin, At least they could interact with the world, for now and in the future.

Without the stability of the country, investors are not going to come in. I previous have a job with a foreign company and at least I have a stable income. I am currently a homemaker as I think that educating children and taking care of them, bring them up well, is as important too.

Thank you very much for all these, I am deeply grateful.

You left. I wet my eyes almost everyday. We no longer can see you LIVE on TV. We lost our precious Great man. No word can express the pain deep in me for losing you, our Singapore Father, Mr Lee KY.

Please take a higher rebirth, Mr Lee.

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


Thank you so much for building this home for us known as Singapore. Without your limitless love, effort and even spending your whole life building it, we won’t be able to live and stay peacefully in such prosperous country and built our lovely home. No matter where I go or where I am, it always made me proud being born and raised as a Singaporean.

Thank you always, as you took great care to all of us liked your children and paved road for us to walk on comfortably. There were too many things to thank you about and too many things that you had delivered to us making what we are today.

We will always remember you in our hearts and love this Singapore which you had spent your whole life building for us. Rest in peace, Mr Lee.
With love and gratitude, Ray Wong & family, 28 March’15

No words can describe and no actions can express my gratitude towards you. Thank you for being a respectable and loving father to all of us Singaporeans. You have contributed a lot and dedicate your life in building Singapore from a mudflat to a metropolis. Your struggles and relentless efforts is what made us who we are today. Your willingness and unconditional love for Singapore has made us one of the most successful countries, transforming us to a first-world country from a third-world country.


Your vision and foresight transformed Singapore to a global metropolis , therefore I feel blessed to be a Singaporean, blessed to be a part of a country full of prosperity, peace and harmony. This is why I’m always proud to call Singapore my home, a place of comfort and joy. No other place in the world can make me feel safer.

Your courage and strong determination always inspires me. There was always an answer to a solution when it comes to you. No matter how daunting the task is, it never seem impossible due to your persistence and hard will. You may be gone however, your memories and laurels lives on. And Singapore is a living proof. You are a fair, righteous, selfless leader, an examplary model for many world leaders.

You will be dearly missed not only by me and my fellow Singaporeans but also by everyone around the world who recognizes you as a visionary and great leader. Your legacy will live on for generations to come.

It is 4.30am Thursday 26 March 2015 as I am penning this down. This is my personal tribute to Mr. Lee Kuan Yew who passed away peacefully on March 23 2015. I have always told my wife, why does anyone pen down a tribute – who reads it anyway! But here I am writing this, with the hope that in another 50 years time, if I am lucky, I get to re-read this note on how I am feeling during this period of national mourning.


Together with my wife and sister-in-laws, we have just paid our respects to Mr. Lee in Parliament House. The mood as we entered the hall was somber. I was nervous, as I didn’t know what sort of emotions would come over me. A big picture of his was in-front of the casket. I moved along the line, stopped and bowed three times. I was straining my neck to try to catch a glimpse of him at peace. I was half hoping that he would get up and start scolding us – “Why are you wasting time queuing? You don’t have to work tomorrow??!!!” My imagination was punctured by a quiet but fast sobbing of an elderly woman who had to be consoled by her daughter. Despite the men in green trying to move the line out as quickly as possible, I slowed down my pace and tried to linger as long as I could near the casket. This was my only and last chance to be close to a great leader and gladiator of Singapore.

I was probably too young to see or understand the changes that Mr. Lee made to Singapore from the late 1950s. I never lived through the Japanese occupation, the uncertain times when the British pulled out of Singapore, the threat of the communist insurgents or the racial and student riots. I don’t know what it is like to live in slumps or the joy of moving to high-rise flats from these slumps. I have never experienced water rationing or the uncertainty of mass unemployment. Hence I must admit, my feeling of sadness is not at the same level as that of my Father and our Pioneer Generation when the news of Mr. Lee’s passing broke on the wee hours of Monday morning. However, I greatly admire and respect Mr. Lee for his values, passion, single-mindedness, intellect and resolve. As with most Singaporeans, I am grateful to Mr. Lee for dedicating his life to Singapore, without which I am not sure we can enjoy the kind of life that we have right now.
Mr. Lee’s values of hard work, integrity, perseverance, and resilience are even more relevant now in this increasingly uncertain world. Many may not have agreed with his knuckle buster and tough love approach to nation building, but it is something befitting of for that period of time. How Mr. Lee came out of his moment of anguish with greater resolve and then went on to achieve greater things is something I am learning with my own moments of anguish. Mr. Lee’s oratory skills is second to none. His speeches were robust and fiery. I remembered watching all of Mr. Lee’s speeches on the internet whilst preparing for a speech examination for a Business Communications module in university. I even tried to learn his habit of pulling his pants up while trying to make a major point!

On our journey back home from Parliament House, we discussed about the future of Singapore after Mr. Lee. My sister in laws felt uncertain at how Singapore will cope should there be a serious crisis. Will our youths have the toughness, guts and gumption to stand up and be counted? Will Singapore have a soul? I don’t think any of us will have the answer. But I think a good start is to make sure that we never forget the Lee Kuan Yew story and that our youths understand what he stands for and what he had had gone through to make Singapore it is today.

May you rest in peace Mr. Lee Kuan Yew.

“Merdeka! One more time with more feeling… Merdeka!”
Melvin Vu

Dearest Mr Lee,
Thank you, although words alone is not enough to express my gratitude to you. I have chosen to stay away from the historic queuing at the Parliament House area, but tostay home to watch the videos of you from early days to the most recent appearance of you, of what you said, what you did and how you transformed mudflats to metropolis.


I never paid so much attention during history lessons in school. This week, Singapore woke up to the fact that the peace and prosperity that we enjoy, have not come by accident. You are the Godsend gift to my country, my home. If not for you, I wouldn’t be blessed with the opportunities at school, at work and raising my children. I am able to speak fluent and write English and Chinese, only because of you.

I wept a lot this week, just like many others in Singapore. I would miss you. For sure, going forward, as I watch our future leaders perform, I will ponder “”what would LKY have done?””

You physically depart tomorrow. We start a new chapter without LKY. But you will watch over us, right?

Rest in peace, Mr Lee.
Agnes Lim

With a heavy heart, the nation bids farewell to an honourable and highly respected leader, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.


Without his vision and strong willpower in building this nation out of nothing, there wouldn’t be Singapore on the map.

前人种树，后人乘凉
Without him and his team, we wouldn’t have a house to live in, potable water straight from the tap, an established and highly efficient transport network compared abroad, a clean and green city. With his strict law and regulation, we don’t have to worry about food safety or crime in our neighbourhood. Not forgetting his bilingualism policy and high quality education system, we have become competent and adept citizens.

Of course, the wise man had done more than the aforementioned.
Mr Lee’s foresight paved the way for the gleaming success of modern Singapore. Indeed, Singapore is our home truly.

Mr Lee will be deeply missed as we won’t see another man like him.

With deepest gratitude and appreciation to our founding father, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
Pamela

Dear Mr. Lky,


Your contribution to this country and its people are indescribable. You took helm of segregated, poor and dirty mess and took it to where it is today. You are passionate, dedicated and your wisdom and foresight remains unparrelled in the region. Your voice and presence commanded the utmost respect and admiration from people worldwide.

Take a look around us and take a moment to think about this. Would things be the same if it wasn’t for you? Would I even be here if it wasn’t for you? I dare say that the train I am riding on as I pen this wouldn’t be here, the HDB I live in wouldn’t be there and the safe society that even most first world country dream of having wouldn’t exist. Singapore wouldn’t exist.

But these are just the tangible things that you have left behind. Looking beyond this, you have left behind something of unfathomable scale. You have created a sense of national identity, a national spirit, a sense of belonging. Singapore Singaporean, that I am proud of.

What is your life story? Your life is the story of how Sigapore came to be what it is. We are eternally grateful for what you have left behind. Your legacy remains.

May you rest in peace.

Prime minister Lee Hsien Loong, I wish to express my deepest and heartfelt condolences to you and your family.
Yours sincerely,Lew Jun Fei

23rd March 2015 was truly a very sad day for all Singaporeans, as our Nation grieved the loss of our founding Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew. Despite that I have never met Mr. Lee in person; he was undoubtedly a legendary great man who I hold in high regard, and his passing deeply pained me.


For many Singaporeans, he was the very man known to have devoted whole of himself, and his life, building Singapore – a place where we are proud to call ‘Our Home’ today. No amount of words can describe my heartfelt gratitude towards him. He was truly a blessing to Singapore.

Thank you Sir, for shining like a candle in the dark, guiding Singapore during her darkest days and bringing her people – hopes. Because of you, each and every Singaporean can dream of a future here. You’re worthy of the honor and love in which you’re held in the hearts of our many Singaporeans today and always. You’re dearly loved and will be remembered. May your soul now rest in peace.

But this is not the end, for your legacy will live on.

The best tribute to Mr. Lee will be we as the Citizens of Singapore, let’s ‘strive on his ideals’ and continue to work hard safeguarding our Nation peace and security, and contribute ourselves to continue help Singapore prospers and flourishes so our next generation after generation could find and ride that rainbow, too.
Joyann Y.

Thank You for your numerous contributions to our beloved homeland Singapore. Without you, Singapore would not be the country we see today. What you have done for us transformed our country from third world to first. You made us proud to be Singaporean, improved our lives and put an emphasis on bilingualism. It was the toughest policy you had made but it was worth it, that is why we can communicate with the world today.


Even though I never met you in my life, I am truly grateful to what you have done for Singapore. You were a man that I respected a lot, a person that I look up to. In the past week, we as a nation stood united and strong, queuing for hours just to see you. This shows what significance you had towards this little tiny red dot. We shall never forget our founding father, and your legacy will leave on for a long time to come, and for the future generation of Singaporeans to know what a fine man you were.

With a heavy heart, I would personally like to thank you Mr Lee, and I hope that you would rest in peace and live a life with no regrets.
Thank You.
谢谢。
Terima Kasih.
நன்றி.

The cortege appeared in sight along New Bridge Road today, and the emotion was palpable in the air. I started tearing, the woman standing next to me started tearing too. As the red and white colours of our flag came closer, the crowd stirred in volume. But we stood calmly behind the blue and white police tape, sharing the space, keeping our umbrellas so that they didn’t block anyone.


My voice strained with emotion, I clutched the flag I had requested off a volunteer from the State Funeral organising committee and waved it at the vehicles passing by. What else could I have said but “”Thank you””? What else could I have said but “”Goodbye””? What was left unspoken was too great to verbalise. Emotion is hard to verbalise, emotion is irrational and unexplained. Amidst the relentless rain, I wiped my face and wasn’t sure if I what I wiped away was rain or tears.

Thank you, Sir. You have left an indelible mark. We are incredibly lucky to have had you. Goodbye.
Cheryl Lim

My family convey deep mourning to your departure. Our condolences are with your family.
Mr. Lee, our sincere appreciation and thanks to you that our family are here today.


Our family and the nation are the witness of your legacy who benefit from your committed, integrated, pragmatic , resilient leadership during extreme global crisis. You have been keeping Singapore shined and onward from one crisis to another.

1997 Catastropic SEA financial crisis, WTC 9-11, SARS, 2009 subprime crisis……..It was your legacy that turned around the nation fast freeing Singapore from severe economy nightmare. In every crisis, you upgraded the nation one step that kept Singapore sustainably competitive in the global economy. The nation was encouraged to improve their cross-border skill through many programs under government schemes. SMEs were getting financial assistance to deal with economy downturn.

You are indeed unmatched visionary statesman. Your spirit and legacy will forever remain with us and the nation setting sustainable standard to the rest of the world.

Please accept our family farewell bid to you Mr. Lee.
You definitely get the highest and most refined place in Him.
Goodbye our beloved hero and founding father of the nation.
Soegiarto Handoko

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


Sir, Today we mourn yor passing but at the same time we celebrate your life too. How many can truly say they have lived their life well lived? There’s so much gratitude for you, 50 years ago, you believed in us, you lifted us up to where we are now. We are aware that we should not be complacent and we are still have a lot of work to do to keep your legacies alive. Sir, you did not let us down 50 years ago, 50 years and many more years from now, we vow not to let you down. You united a nation then and in your passing, you unite us once again. We are truly One People One Nation One Singapore, regardless of race and religion, we put aside our differences and come together to give you a final bow and say thank you for your all you have done for us!

My only regrets is not being able to let you know how much we appreciated you while you were still with us. You must have heard more complains and grumbling from us than gratidue, for that we are sorry.

Sir, We have not stopped tearing since 23 March and we are sure going to miss you.. We were hoping that you can wait till 9/8 and celebrate SG50 with us, you deserved that! Heart will ache and tears will flow again when we see your empty seat! Your absence will be surely be felt!

Rest now Sir, your wife is waiting to reunite with you. She has selflessly shared you with us and it is only right that we return you to her. Go smell the flowers, listen to the birds sing and stroll with her, just like what you like to do when she was alive. Do not worry about us, we have grown up and will take care of ourselves. You put us on the world map, you made us stand tall and proud, you showed the world where Singapore is. From now on, we shall return this favour by not letting you down and making you proud of us. And lastly, my promise to you is I will vote wisely so that we do not fall into wrong hands and destroy what you have built the last 50 years.

Once again Mr Lee, thank you for all that you have done for us and sorry for not letting you know earlier…

May you reunite with Mrs Lee and God bless both your souls and your family !

With much love from us at home
Magdalene Foo

Thank you for giving us education and equal opportunities and for making Singapore a successful first world nation today.


Your bilingual policy has really benefitted me especially when my family had work assignment in USA in 1985 and China ultimately. Being fluent in both English and Chinese has help me to connect easily with people in other parts of the world.

When I was staying in Suzhou in 2006 , drivers , domestic helpers and common folks I meet are full of admiration and highest respect for Mr Lee Kuan Yew. They told me they are very grateful to Mr Lee as Singapore Suzhou Industrial Project has created job opportunities and improve the livelihood of millions of people there. The reputation of Singapore is definitely very high.

It must be a miracle for Singapore to have a such a great leader and one who has devoted his life to us for 6 decades. Thank you Mr Lee Kuan Yew for everything you have done.

Forever grateful to you
Teck Chor ( a proud Singaporean)

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
You once cried for us now is our turn to cry for you.You spent your life building Singapore and it went to third world to first thanks to your hard work and resilience. If it wasn’t for you we would not be here today.Thank you for everything you have done you were a great leader and an excellent role model.
Sincerely, Carolina Khor Rui Dan 12 years old White sands primary school 6B

Let me express my utmost appreciation, respect and admiration for Mr Lee who has contributed so much to our country and home, Our Singapore.


Elevating Singapore to the world stage with his talents and leadership, our Little Red Dot, Our Singapore, is able to make ourselves heard.

Exemplifying the virtues of a good leader, we look towards the continuation of Mr Lee’s legacy in Singapore.

Key to our transformation from a mudflat to a metropolis, we are eternally grateful to Mr Lee for the leap to the status of a developed economy.

Unwavering and determined in making sure Singapore survives with its newly found independence in 1965, he shows all Singaporeans the power of strong determination and willpower.

An icon of Singapore, we will always remember Mr Lee for his contributions.

Now and forever, history will remember Mr Lee for his foresight, intelligence, charisma and his love for our nation, Singapore.

Young and old, we Singaporeans must continue the good work Mr Lee has started and bring Singapore towards prosperity and a greater profile on the world stage.

Education and Meritocracy, these policies have benefitted many Singaporeans who have achieved social mobility.

We will always remember you, our dearest Mr Lee.

我们会永远怀念您, 建国总理李光耀先生。
DELIA LIM HWEE HWEE

Dear Mr Lee
No amount of words can express the gratitude for the sacrifices you made to make Singapore she is today.


Without your foresight and leadership, my family and I would not have a clean, green and first world Singapore to proudly call home.

Your passing is truly a great loss to us, but your legacy will live on in our hearts forever.

Once again, thank you so very much for giving your life in building up this nation with your life.

Rest in peace, Sir. Serene Tan

Dearest Mr Lee Kuan Yew


On 25th March Time : 0150am -My son and I went to Parliament and pay you our last respect.

I shared my thoughts to my 18 yrs old son ( this May he will be joining the Army) that tonight although is a long queue but WHAT Is 3 hours queuing compared to ‘YOU ‘ MR LEE who has spent and sacrifices yourself for more than ‘5 Decades ‘ with your entire life ‘Protecting ‘ us and this country Singapore from being Harm and your ‘Never Fear ‘ positive leadership just like a responsible father .

When I was reading the newspaper about You Mr Lee and there was 1paragraph recalled about you called your sister and told her you have lost some weight ,you were having the craving of eating ‘Nonya food ‘ .. Sir , my heart goes to you and felt so sad because I know Mrs Lee was no longer there to cook for your favorite food .

I then shared and read this news to my 18yrs old son and told him that -at that moment when Mr Lee told his sister about his craving for Nonya food , it must be hard for him as Mr Lee must be at the same time thinking and missed his dearest wife Mrs Lee dearly.

My Dearest Mr Lee , I want you to know you are always in my prayer and you are :

1. God Sent
2. Special and Unique
3. A Loving father to every Single
Singaporean
4. A Loving husband (as i watched on TV how you lovingly gave Mrs Lee 2kisses ) and a responsible daddy to your dearest family.

Sir, with your ‘SUPERD ‘ Leadership and with all your entire life and the sacrifices you have done for us .. May I dedicate a Special word -‘SING’ to you as how I see it describe about YOU:

SING :
S describe you as -A SINCERE AND SPECIAL MAN
I describe you as – A man that highly practice and believed in ‘ INTEGRITY’
N as in how you have thought us ‘NEVER FEAR’
G describe you as – ‘GOD SENT’ and a ‘GRACIOUS Husband and Father.

Sir, please ‘Rest In Peace ‘ and May you in heaven be united with Mrs Lee ..

We loved you,
Mdm SK YEO, Mstr Son TH

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,

You have inspired a nation. You have given us hope. You have taught us important virtues such as hard work, determination,
honesty, integrity and respect. Most of all, you have built Singapore to be a place where all Singaporeans have the
opportunities to excel and maximise their fullest potential, regardless of our social economic background. For all that you
have done for Singapore, we THANK YOU. – John Ng, CEO

Thank you for your courage, your strength. Thank you for the Singapore today. There will not be another one like you in many
years to come. R.I.P Mr. Lee. – Karyn Tan

I have been following the daily broadcasts about you and your personal and political life. As a proud citizen of Singapore, I
have read and witnessed so many of your remarkable achievements. I have lived and worked in several countries and can
understand and appreciate why you had taken certain tough and unpopular decisions along the way. I believe your vision and
determination to strive for excellence had been of tremendous benefit to all of us in Singapore. What you had done, you did
for the good of Singapore. Over the last few days, you have been described in many ways but what I can relate to from your
speeches and achievements is that you were an extraordinary human being of profound intelligence, one who was
compellingly articulate and obsessively passionate. Thank you for making Singapore what it is. May your soul rest in peace. –
Sandeep Mahawar & Family

We love YEW! Thanks for giving us a Prosperous & Metropolitan Garden City that we can call HOME. We will continue to build
on the legacy that you have left behind. – Kah Chye & Serene

On behalf of my family members, we are really grateful for your dedication in founding and building this country into a
modern, clean and multi-racial society. We will always be grateful for your hard work for Singapore and for the world. Thank
you very much Mr Lee. – Dewi

Without the great leadership of Mr. Lee Kuan Yeow and his team, we will not have the modern Singapore that we have today.
I sincerely appreciate and am thankful for Mr Lee Kuan Yeow and his team’s contributions to nation building all these years. –
Andrea Low

“Life dies, memories remain”… With deepest respect and admiration, I would like to express my thanks to Mr Lee Kuan Yew
for building and sharing this beautiful country. – Alfredo Mariscal Arcila

Thank you for all the things you’ve done to transform Singapore into such a great place to live, work and play. We are very
proud to be Singaporeans, and very proud and grateful to have you as our founding father – one who had always done things
with Singapore’s interests at heart. We also admire your continuous learning and continuous improvement spirit, and it is this
spirit that has made Singapore such a successful, prosperous, efficient and productive country that is so highly regarded by
countries all around the world! Indeed, Singapore and we, wouldn’t be where we are today without you and your leadership.
You will always be in our hearts and we will miss you! Rest in peace. – Hiew Mon Xir

My Mom & Dad were from Muar, Johor and had settled down in Singapore back in the 50’s. During that time, Mr Lee was the Legal Advisor to the labour unions, following his graduation from Cambridge University. Mr Lee would later become our very first Prime Minister and build our Nation into what it is today.
When I was growing up, my Dad would always praise Mr Lee and share all the wonderful things Mr Lee did in building the
nation. When many of my Dad’s friends decided to return to Malaysia after the separation in 1965, my Dad never even
thought of following them. He asked how could he return to Malaysia when Mr Lee had given him work stability,
opportunities to raise his children well, and provided a good education system here in Singapore. Even after the sad event
happened on 13th May 1969, my Dad didn’t think of returning to Muar, his hometown. He said he owed it to Mr Lee to stay.
And since then the whole family knew what Mr Lee really meant to him. – Azman

A great leader – love for wife, love for family and love for the nation. Rest in Peace Mr Lee KY. – Lisa Lim

Singapore has always been synonymous with Mr Lee Kuan Yew, to the point where sometimes, we almost believed that he would live forever. His “never quit” attitude in bringing continuous success to Singapore through his great leadership is unforgettable. I am much impressed by the way he spoke to youngsters, awaking and arising minds with tremendous drive
spirit and energy in his speeches. I like this quote from him on what it means to be an educated man: “My definition of an educated man is a man who never
stops learning and wants to learn”. MY SALUTE TO THE GREAT MAN WHO WILL EVER LIVE IN THE HEARTS OF SINGAPOREANS AND ITS RESIDENTS – S. Seshadri

Mr Lee Kuan Yew, a genuine political giant, a man who fought long and hard against corruption and extremism, and
transformed a politically unstable tiny island with no natural resources, and threatened by communism in the early days, into
one of the wealthiest and most secured nations in the world. Words can never express how thankful we are for what you
have done and where you have placed us in the world. May you rest in peace and God bless! – Mohd Naseer

An irreplaceable leader. His passing on will leave a big dent in the hearts of all Singaporeans. Though we knew that this day
will come, it is still very painful to lose him. Whenever I travel overseas, there is never a moment that I do not feel proud to be
holding a Red Passport, and that is all due to him. Rest In Peace Mr Lee. – Seah Chui Lian

Because of you, I can hold my Singapore passport high in the air and tell the world that I am from Singapore and I am proud to
be Singaporean. Thank you, Mr Lee, for everything you have done for Singapore and all fellow Singaporeans. You will be
missed. – Larry Tay

Singapore is respected and recognised internationally as clean and green, safe, highly efficient, meritocratic; with minimal
corruption, good racial harmony, strong harmonious union-business relationships; is a key Asian financial hub, one of the
world’s busiest seaports, the best airport, one of world’s highest GDP, etc. From Third World to First, all these were achieved
in one generation. Thanks for everything and rest in peace, Mr Lee. – Tang Wing Fatt

It was your vision and leadership that led to the success which Singapore enjoys today. You have left an enduring legacy. My
family and I owe you a debt of gratitude, and you will be deeply missed. Thank you, Mr Lee! – Carolyn Khng

Thank you for all that you’ve done for Singapore. You will forever be in our hearts. We will always respect you. May you rest in
peace. – Deep in our hearts, Lina Wee

I am a great admirer of Mr Lee Kuan Yew. He has shown great vision and determination in bringing Singapore to its current
status – a truly remarkable achievement indeed. He will remain a role model for me for the rest of my life, especially having
experienced what Singapore is, first hand, over the last six and a half years. In this moment of sadness, I pray for him. – Sriram
Narayanan

Mr Lee’s passing is a great loss to Singapore. He was our David in the landscape of Super powers. Our great sage held in awe
and sought after by world leaders. Our pride and joy.
What he has done has taken much passion, grit and determination. Singapore’s success story is a feat which is hard to repeat
and replicate. I am proud to be part of this country where I can be assured of fair treatment, equal opportunity, safety and
freedom. But we can never take these for granted.
We should be always vigilant, think of our fellow men and strive for the betterment of each other. – Juniper Chua

Words will not suffice to express our gratitude. Even as we grieve, the outpouring of heartfelt community spirit in the Padang
queue, as one united people, stands testament to your life’s achievements. We are indeed blessed to have had you as the
founding Prime Minister. I salute you Sir, for your unwavering love for your wife and selfless passion for Singapore. Thank you
Mr Lee. – Jan Woon

They say history is made by great men and I truly believe so. Mr Lee rose amongst common men during the early tumultuous
years of Singapore’s independence and shouldered a nation’s hopes and dreams. He led the nation to her success through his
wisdom, foresight, grit and a deep conviction to better the lives of fellow Singaporeans. Today, we mourn the passing of a
great man. But, we seek comfort that his name shall forever be engraved in the history of Singapore. His vision shall be
propagated by every Singaporean. Thank you Sir, for everything you have done for us all. – Lim Bing Yao

We Singaporeans are blessed to have had such a great leader. We will not be where we are today without him. He fought for
us and spent his life building a successful Singapore. Everything he did and every decision he made, was for the good of
Singapore and its people. He left behind a huge legacy, and we will continue to build on what he left for us. Thank you so
much Mr Lee Kuan Yew!! – Ang Pei Pei

We are deeply saddened by the passing of Singapore’s visionary Founding Father, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Singapore is a small
country without natural resources. Mr Lee transformed Singapore from a third world country to a first world one which is
admired by world leaders. We are grateful for his immense contributions and the legacy he has left behind. We wish his soul
will rest in peace forever. – Mohd Asaduzzaman Chowdhury

Really, how do you thank someone who has taken an entire Nation from mudflats to metropolis, from insignificant to globally respected, from Third World to First, and all in one generation? He did not do it alone, but we couldn’t have done it without him either. Tributes have been pouring in in all shapes and forms from around the world, but no amount of words, song or dance will ever be enough to describe our gratitude. So when all is said and done, all we can really offer is a feeble “Thank you, Mr Lee”. Rest well in the knowledge that we will do our utmost to ensure that your Legacy lives on. – Simon Ang

In this period of national mourning, the scene created by thousands of Singaporeans – elderly, children and people of all races and religion – queueing up in an orderly manner & waiting for hours to pay their last respects to the Late Mr Lee, has greatly touched not only Singaporeans but the whole world. It seems that even in death, Mr Lee has helped make Singapore a more
united and stronger nation. One of the beliefs of Buddhism is that death gives rise to birth – if there were no death, there would be no birth, as this is part
of any life cycle. In this period of deep sorrow, the dream of all Singaporeans will be that the spirit, wisdom, vision, integrity, dedication and commitment of the late Mr Lee can be recycled back into this world so that there will be a better world tomorrow. Lastly, my deepest and heartfelt condolences to PM Lee and his family, as well as to all Singaporeans, for the loss of such a
great man. – Daniel Tan

Over the past few days, we have all taken time to stop and reflect on what MM Lee has done to bring Singapore from a third world country to where it is today. Through this process, I come to appreciate and understand the depth and enormity of what has become of Singapore which I have taken for granted all this while. I think this is an important point for us who have not personally experienced the drastic change from the mud lands of yesteryear to the modern and prosperous Metropolis of today. Singapore could have been a very different country and our lives could have been very different if not for Mr Lee. So
much of what we have today is because of what he had done for us all. In that sense, we did not so much earn but inherited what we have and for that, he is rightly called our founding father. As the nation mourns the death of Mr Lee this past week, his passing on has united our nation as I have never seen before.
Using the words of my pastor who put it so aptly, “During your life time, you forged us into a nation. At your death, you brought us together as a family”. These words capture this moment beautifully. I feel as if Singapore has once again discovered her identity as a people and as a nation. We have all been drawn into and have personalized the narrative of a nation which is unique and extraordinary. His death has in some ways “re-founded” Singapore. Thank you so, so much Mr Lee. You have our utmost respect and gratitude. – Lam Zheng Xin

In yesterday’s Special Parliamentary Sitting to pay tribute to the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Minister Ng Eng Hen recounted this of Mr Lee: In 1968, an MP asked in Parliament, how the British withdrawal would impact Singapore. Mr Lee told Singaporeans plainly that the British bases made up 20 per cent of the GNP and tens of thousands of jobs would be lost. To overcome this drastic impact, Singaporeans would have “to adapt and adjust, without any whimpering or wringing of hands, as a way of life which they have been accustomed to over 30 years comes to an end”. When another MP followed and asked if economic aid from the British could ease the effects of the pull-out, Mr Lee’s quick and unequivocal rejoinder was that any aid should “not make us dependent on perpetual injections of aid from the outside”, that “…we cannot change our attitude to life, that the world does not owe us a living and that we cannot live by the begging bowl. The best way of meeting the problem is to go about it quietly and intelligently discussing our problems in a low key and with as little fuss and bother as possible.” It is clear that Singapore would not have come this far without Mr Lee’s brilliant and decisive leadership. Mr Lee was a tough man, and he brought the country through tough times. As a child of the 80’s, I have grown up in relative peace and prosperity as compared to those before my time. The Singapore River was already clean and flanked by gleaming skyscrapers, and Singapore, with its gushing Merlion, had made it as a First World country that many in the region were envious (and some might say, jealous) of. In school, we were constantly reminded that we should not rest on the laurels of those before us, and that we should continue to work hard to progress our nation. Singapore has come this far by being stoic and pragmatic and industrious, and we should not lose these values. We are still today, a young nation and even as we remember the achievements that have been accomplished by those before us, more importantly we should remember that hardships can come in different forms. It is wise that we do not become complacent nor divisive, and continue to stand united as a one people to weather through thick and thin. Mr Lee shall remain always a great inspiration for my generation and generations to come. – Lee Hui Ying

When Mr Lee took over as PM of Singapore in the 1960s, our country was in bad shape. There were racial conflicts in neighbouring countries which also affected us. For the poorer citizens, the living standard was worse than “third world”. There were no natural resources to depend on. Jobs were difficult to find and the pay was not enough to survive on. Gang activities, robberies, bullying and thefts were rampant. Life was tough, with nothing much to look forward to. With his great leadership, farsighted vision and strategies, determination and guts, Mr Lee:
• United people of all races and religion with an efficient and honest government.
• Assembled our Total Defence capabilities when the British left us. This in turn gave us peace for the past 50 years.
• Upgraded our education system to suit the country’s needs, and attracted so many MNCs to invest here like “Magic”. Singapore prospered in just one generation under his leadership.
• Reclaimed land at Jurong Island, Tuas and other parts of Singapore to grow our economy.
• Pushed hard and improved the people’s lives by ensuring that eventually every citizen owns his own house. Infrastructures he built were extensively comprehensive, like the MRT, hospitals, expressways, reservoirs, etc.
• Succeeded in building the Best Airport in the World, the Best Airline in the World and the No. 1 Seaport in the world. He made us the third largest oil refining centre in the world.
• Made Singapore the safest place in the world to live in.
• Succeeded in seawater desalination and used-water recycling. We are now less dependent on imported water.
• Cleaned up the Singapore river

SLNG was built by his team to secure our energy needs in the future. The wonderful things Mr Lee did for Singapore will take us a very long time to put on record. Look around you, we are no
more without “natural resources” and poor. He has given us all we need. Although we are small, we have everything that other big countries have. The strong Singapore Dollar brings us to anywhere in the world we want to. Thank you very much Mr Lee. These few days, the feeling has been sad and a bit odd. Like a family member has been lost. – Neo Lye Hock

Dear founding father,
I am really sad to hear about your passing. I wish you could celebrate SG50 with us.
Thank you for leading us to build Singapore into a beautiful garden city and give us a bright future.
I will promise to study hard, contribute to the society and make you proud.
I love you and miss you always.

Who says Singapore has no personality?
During this entire week, I was deeply touched by the numerous heartwarming moments- people extending kindness to each other in the queue, helping the elderly, random conversations and smiles exchanged between strangers, the determination of Singaporeans to pay their last respect despite the long wait, fatigue or the hot sun. Not to mention, the kindness of volunteers passing down food and water, it made me felt so well taken care of. Even Singaporeans in other parts of the world have united to pay respect to our Father of the nation in the respective countries.


Today, as the cortege passed by, despite the really strong rain, people immediately put down their umbrellas and even squatted down so that those at the back could see the cortege. I was so touched, it was such consideration. After which, everyone spontaneously sang the National Anthem in the pouring rain. I felt like I was in a scene of a movie. It was so moving.

All these moments are so indescribable, it is AMAZING. I am sure many would have felt the same way I do.

What did we do to be blessed with such a great leader who put in so much hard work that we have what we have today. Not only this, our Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is such an endearing leader. He looked so tired, yet he still personally came down to the queue to thank the people. How blessed are we to have these 2 amazing leaders who cares so much for the nation.

Living in Singapore is like living in paradise. I truly feel so fortunate to be born a Singaporean; a country with caring leaders, a country that is determined, caring, giving, respectful and grateful.

Being on exchange has opened my eyes, for the Singapore I used to take for granted, I appreciate it dearly now. I remembered fondly how when I touched down at Changi Airport from exchange, I was so overwhelmed because I was finally back home. And there is no place like home. Actually, I do think Singapore has a personality, perhaps we are just too shy to express it.

“While we struggled before to define what it meant to be a Singaporean, we suddenly realized what it meant to be one.“

In the past week, we saw unity in spirit, first hand experienced these indescribable and heartwarming moments. Perhaps, this is Lee Kuan Yew’s last gift for us- one united people. May this Singapore spirit continue to burn and live in us. Our Father, Lee Kuan Yew would be very proud and happy to see that.

Thank you Mr. Lee for your dedication and perseverance. Singapore today would not have come about without you and your visionary leadership.


I admire the ethics, principles and forward looking policies you practice and put in place, your discipline, thirst for knowledge and lifelong learning. Your never-ending passion and drive for Singapore, the difficult battles you fought and sacrifices you made for her cannot be revered enough. There is no person like you.

Lee Kuan Yew is Singapore and you made what Singapore is today, a developed nation, small yet packs a mighty punch, safe and peaceful yet brimming with opportunities, your incredible foresights and planning for the country and people, enabling us to be beneficiaries of your legacies.

No words can describe my gratitude, the emotions and sadness felt on your passing. You have fought a great battle Sir. Farewell and Rest in Peace.

Emily Tan

Dearest Mr Lee,
There is no words to describe how we feel about your passing. The only way to thank you is to keep moving forward to continue nurture what you have passed on to us. To keep you in our memories, to be united as a Nation as a Family. To live our lives with no regrets. Hard work and effort never betrays.


In the end it’s not the years in your life that count. It’s the life in your years.

Thanks to you Mr Lee, I am proud to be a Singaporean.

May I extend my heartfelt condolences to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his family on the loss of Mr Lee Kuan Yew.


Singapore is my adoptive home. I was a refugee from the Sino-Japanese War in China. Little did my parents realise that the Japanese would invade Singapore as well, in the Second World War. Born during war-torn years, I carry the name of An in Chinese, or Peace. If you had predicted a peaceful future for me at my birth, you would most likely be laughed at. However, in my new home in Singapore, and against all odds, peace has, in reality, been maintained since the end of WWII, largely through the far-sighted policies of Mr Lee.

We had split from Malaysia at our Independence and had nearly come to blows with Indonesia during Konfrontasi (1963-66), but, in the main, our multi-racial and multi-religious nation has pulled together in the face of adversity and imminent danger. Although Mr Lee has asked many sacrifices of us, we have lived up to his expectations in the hope of a better future. It looks almost as if the future has arrived in the present.

I could have ended up calling England, the USA, New Zealand or Malaysia my home but for fortuitous accidents which have root me to Singapore. I should be proud to die in the same country as Mr Lee – a lesser mortal perhaps, but sharing the honour he has brought to a country which he has created in a better world.

I am a Singaporean residing in the Netherlands for more than 10 years. My citizenship remains as Singapore. Because I feel very proud to be a Singaporean. Often, when I introduce myself at work or with friends, many people know Singapore and all the achievements. Some typical Singapore traits are the famous chewing gum ban; in the begin, people finds it amusing but later people see the need!


It was you, Mr. Lee who created a successful country and made us lift our heads up high where ever we are. I personally admire your wisdoms and the passion you have which gave you continued energy to fight for a world class country among our neighbours. I thank you sincerely.
Evelyn Ng

Dear Mr Lee, Sir


I have never met you but since your passing, I have watched your speeches and read much about you in this recent week. Like many Singaporeans, I felt an emotional attachment with you. I am deeply grateful for your tremendous dedication in building Singapore and your immense love and passion for her people. You are the blood that pulse through the veins of Singapore. You have taught is what 饮水思源 means – I now understand the source and importance of our water and appreciate the greenery we enjoy. I will always strife to behave like a first world citizen living in a first world oasis. May we endeavor to maintain this city in a garden as passionately as you did and teach our children to conserve our water supply. You leave behind a legacy that shall be passed on to many future generations to come. May your soul rest peacefully in heaven, your spirit lies in the hearts of Singaporeans. With deepest gratitude…

Dear Mr Lee
I am writing this from my room in a 3-room flat in Ang Mo Kio. I can own this home because of you, because of all you have stood for, believed in, sacrificed for. No amount of words can fully describe the depth of my gratitude. Your love and devotion to Mrs Lee has touch my heart so deeply, a love so true and committed. There are things that will be taught to us and will make such a deep impact, and these are not by words but by your actions, your living it out, the examples you set.
I am deeply honored, thankful, grateful, privilege to have you as the leader of Singapore. There will never be another Lee Kuan Yew like the one Singaporeans know.


Thank you, Mr Lee.
Sum Wei Yee

When I was a child, my father would insist that my sibling and I listen to Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s National Day Rally speeches on television. My father wanted us to learn to speak well (i.e. in grammatically-correct English), speak with conviction and hold the attention of an audience. I am not sure how much of these skills I have managed to develop over the years, but the memory of Mr Lee’s strength as an orator, his tenacity, and dedication to excellence will stay with me and continue to inspire me.

Sumi

Dear Mr Lee,


Thank you for the sacrifices you had to make to build this nation and for the courage to stand up to your dissidents. You fought bravely for your convictions and did not “suffer fools”….and why should we indeed suffer those who do not place the highest good before our self-interest.

Ultimately choosing to benefit the masses will eventually benefit oneself as we are part of the same fabric.

You will always be larger than life itself and your passing on, while leaving a vaccum, does also leave a lasting and solid legacy for Singaporeans to sustain and improve upon with pride and competency.

Thank you once again for enabling us to take pride in being a Singaporean. Please continue to watch over us in your spiritual form and protect this island, our home.

Love & Light,
Sean Foo Suan An

Dearest Mr Lee,
I am deeply grief since 23 Mar 15. This whole week of mourning is extremely difficult as we still cannot accept the fact that you have left us. All of us wanted you to be present in SG50.


We have seen how you have transformed Singapore, battle all the challenges and fight against the odds for our independence. We are where we are now, because of you, our great and one & only founding father of Singapore.

You have spent all your life to build and to create Singapore. You have laid the foundation and have given us a country that we can call it our nation, a HDB housing that we can call it our home, a bilingual education that we can call it our strength, not forgetting our water supply and public transport, etc. We are the beneficiaries of your legacy.

It is a country that is well recognised and respected by all countries across the globe. You made us feel proud of our country and proud to be Singaporean. 感谢、感激、感恩.

As long as there is Singapore, there is Mr Lee Kuan Yew. We will always remember you in this generation, next generation and many generations ahead.

I am glad that I was able to pay my last resoect to you at the Parliament House , pen tributes at Raffles Institutions and Tanjong Pagar Community Centre, involved in your funeral service on 29 Mar 15 at the beginning and at the end.of the route.

Current PM (Lee Hsien Loong ), we know this week has been extremely difficult for you.. It is going to be very challenging for you going forward to carry on with your beloved father’s legacy and to build on it to the next level . You can make it. Take care and 加油!
Goh Bee Lay

Dear Mr. Lee Kuan Yew,
I am 61 years old and have experienced the growth of Singapore since the day you shouldered the unenviable responsibilities of building our tiny island nation. It was a monumental task with no room for error. We had no industries, no agriculture, high unemployment rate, racial tension, low literacy rate, not-so-nice neighbors and practically no foreign reserves to speak of. Many of our neighbors were waiting to see us fail. We didn’t. You led us out of the swamps and built Singapore into a 1st world country in less than 50 years. Your vision, perseverance, determination, intelligence and raw courage saw us through. What you did was much more than a miracle. Sometimes I wonder whether you have a crystal ball.


You built Singapore on all fronts which enabled us to overcome any obstacles from any directions. To call you a giant among men is an understatement. You are a true nation builder who is rarely seen in history. We fortunate to have you.

To thank you for what you did is hardly enough but I assure you that we will continue your good works and keep you in our hearts and minds at all time.

Rest in Peace, Mr. Lee.
Norman Lim

Dear Mr. Lee
Thank you for the many things you have done for Singapore.
I feel that your biggest contribution to Singapore is leading Singapore to independence. You had made a lot of effort to make Singapore what it is today, from a third world country to this famous red dot. You never gave up this country when times were bad. Instead, you worked even harder, leading Singaporeans through ups and downs. I cannot thank you enough for whatever you had done for our country, making it glow in just a few decades. Always remembering you, founding father of Singapore, in our hearts.
Lu Xue’er, Cadee (Pasir Ris Primary School)

Where the wild wind blows
Where my heart stilled
Under the blanket of sorrows

The days of passing

Torturous to mine soul

Rest In Peace Sir

Dear Mr Lee, thank you for all your hard work and sacrifices you have given to Singapore. There are no words that can express my gratitude and respect I have for you. You have devoted your whole life carving a nation, not for yourself, but for the people of Singapore and our future generations. 50 years ago you shed your tears for Singapore, now we Singaporeans and other parts of the world are shedding their tears for the loss of a true giant leader. It will be very hard to find another remarkable world leader like yourself Mr Lee. Without you, there will be no modern Singapore. Singapore would still be a little red dot among the other big nations. Now Singapore is a big commercial hub, being able to work collaborately with the other big nations in the world. You are not only a widely respected leader but also a kind hearted and soft man, whom many older generations have shared their beautiful encounters they had with you. You will be remembered for many generations to come. Thank you once again Mr Lee. Rest in peace.
S H KOH

I am in that generation of fortunate Singaporeans who have benefited the most from Mr Lee’s leadership. We did not suffer through the formative years of the nation in the early sixties and were largely shielded from the difficulties that the nation faced after Singapore’s separation from Malaysia. Yet, we have benefited from being in a safe and secure English speaking nation with a good quality of life. We benefited from the meritocratic policies which allowed us to train in our chosen profession-medicine. We were sent overseas to the best centres in the world to train with government support. We returned to a much admired healthcare system to do good work. Thank you Mr Lee for our little country that is big in the world’s eyes, for our lives and for giving us a livelihood and a future. May you rest in peace.
Andrew Khoo

Dear Founding Father Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


Thank you for making it possible for my grandparents and parents to make it through the hardships of olden Singapore. For that, I am grateful to you, for I will not be here writing this piece of tribute without your wise leadership for your people.

You do not know me for who I am, but it does not matter. I know what you have done for us. That is, well, important. You built Singapore to be clean, green, efficient and organised for the benefit for all of us. This has made me so proud to be part of Singapore. Maybe this is why I had decided to join the civil service 13 years ago, and I never looked back since. You paved the road for my generation, so that we can do more to continue your legacy.

I was deeply saddened as I listened to PM Lee addressed the nation about your demise on 23 March. It must be really hard for him. It was, for me. I came to the realisation that you are, so much a part of my life, only with your passing on. Indeed, I felt as if an important piece of my beautiful puzzle has gone missing. When I paid my respects to you this morning at the Parliament House, finally, I could choke back my tears no more.

Thank you, Sir, for all your hard work and giving your all, your life, to us. We will stay strong. May you rest in peace.

My deepest condolences to PM Lee and the family of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

Buan Hui Ni

Dear Mr Lee,


We would like to thank you for building up Singapore so that we could walk with pride and dignity as Singaporean, able to stand up against our peers in the world.

The Singapore branding has come to be associated with efficiency, trustworthiness and honesty. It is these traits that allow us to punch above and beyond what a small country could do.

In a way the history of Singapore Urological Association mirrors the history of Singapore. We are but a small group of urologists compared to the other Asian countries, let alone the rest of the world. Under the meritocratic system you have created and armed with scholarship by the government, we were sent to top medical centres in the world to learn new skills and technology so that we could bring them back to Singapore and use it for the good of our people. It also helps to put Singapore at the cutting edge of medicine and biotechnology, far beyond most Asian countries. The ties that we have established with experts overseas further seal our fame as a leading regional centre for medical excellence.

We always look beyond the shores of Singapore as you have always proposed and thus our annual local meeting had expanded to become a regional type meeting with overseas experts coming over to share their knowledge, an opportunity that is hard to come by unless you fly over to the Americas or Europe.

Thank you Mr Lee for building up a stable and cohesive nation, gives us immense opportunities beyond our imagination and expand our horizon to look further than our own limitation.

Rest in peace, Sir.

Dear Mr. Lee Kuan Yew,
You had been an inspiration and the pride of all Singaporeans. We cannot thank you enough for your wholehearted contribution to Singapore and Singapore will not be what it is today without You.


Thank you for the tears you wept when we separated from Malaysia. Thank you for the hard work in achieving racial harmony, meritocracy and economic stability. Thank you for believing in your people and leading us for many decades no matter how desperate the situation seemed. Thank you for always putting Singapore’s interest first, always looking out for her until the very end.

Sir, you will be dearly missed and Singapore will never be the same without you. May you rest in peace and continue believing in us, your people, as we work hard for an even brighter Singapore. God bless you.
Rey Chen

I was born on 26th Oct 1955 – Pioneer Generation, 2nd Class


I grew up during the tumultuous years of pre and post independence, experienced the racial riots first hand as fighting and killings happened just outside my primary school compound while we were in class, the separation from Malaysia, the British pullout and much more.

I first saw Mr Lee Kuan Yew when my father brought me, a young boy of 7 or 8 years old, to listen to him speak somewhere near the old Change Alley area (I can’t remember exactly where). The first thing that struck me was his booming voice and his body actions, especially his hands, and his facial expressions. He spoke powerfully and with emotion. I did not fully understood the meaning of what was spoken but he gave me the impression that he was a leader, a great leader, that he was someone who would fulfill his promises, someone who would guide us and take care of us and fight for us.

All through the years, my impression of him had not changed from the above. In fact, as I grew up, became more mature and was exposed to lives and conditions in other countries I began to appreciate Mr Lee Kuan Yew even more. His vision and foresight, his belief in himself, his team and his people, his determination to accomplish whatever he sets out to do or achieve, his meticulous planning to achieve his goals for the country, his righteousness and much much more.

What he has instilled most in me, and I believe in most Singaporean of my generation is the need to continually strive to be the best through hard work, honesty, self-sacrifice and compassion to compliment the skills and intelligence needed to perform any job, any role. Most of all, I will forever remember what he had been drumming to all of us from the first day, that we must continually strive not only to be, but to remain, “one united people regardless of race, language or religion”.

Mr Lee Kuan Yew, go in peace knowing that you had achieved what you set out to do and much much more. You had put in place both the hardwares as well as the softwares for the current and future generations of Singaporeans to thrive.

Thank you and God Bless!
Peter Soh

Dear Sir,
I regret that I was not able to bid you farewell. Nonetheless I stayed up late in a bid to watch the live stream of your funeral.


Sir, you are an inspiration to us all. Singapore did not deserve you, it was too small a stage for you. I do not know what Singapore did to deserve you, but it was our luck that we did. I thank you, founding father, for the security and the prosperity you have brought to our nation. Whilst your policies were never short of critics, many of us have benefited from them unknowingly. Sir, even whilst people of my generation have been said to be unacquainted to the trials and the hardship your generation has been through to secure our future, your legacy lives on in us. For that, we are forever grateful. Indeed, without your work on Singapore, many of us would not be where we are.

Sir, there will never be another like you. Singapore was too small a stage. Even many have known your name but not Singapore’s. Yet, we, your people, will remember you not merely for your wit and your combative nature, your frankness and honesty that has earned the respect of world leaders, but we will remember you for the life that you have sacrificed to build this country from scratch, for the tears you shed for us. Today, we shed tears for your passing.

Sir, if not for you, i would not be in the UK studying law now. I have seen you only once whilst having a lunch at Raffles Hotel. I remember being surprised at how tall you were. Sir, even though I do not know you personally, I will aspire to live by your virtues. And even though I have not witnessed first hand the development you have brought to Singapore, I am grateful for the comfort that I was born into. Singapore lives on, a grateful people who will continue your legacy.

Sir, you were too big for Singapore. We never deserved you. You were not a man of God, but perhaps you were a man from God. Sir, we will fly the flag proudly wherever we are, wherever we are planted.

Rest in peace, we will continue your legacy.
Gabriel

A man whose fearless character and love for the nation will never be forgotten.


A voice that spoke foresight, that understood the vitality of change, perseverance and resilience to continuously improve ourselves and our country.

A heart that lead with our other founding fathers, the hope for the succession of better days, security and community.

A founding father and inspirational leader whose legacy lives on in each and every Singaporean.

**

What we remember of who Lee Kuan Yew was, is what he himself would have wanted each of us to be; for our nation, for our home, for our loved ones and for ourselves.

May we find it within each of ourselves to do the same for future generations, the way we look back in heartfelt gratitude to what one man’s life and his team painstakingly and tirelessly strived for us.

May the Lord continue to watch and shower blessings upon Singapore and her people, as we continue to evolve together to build each other up in love, kindness and generous community. In Jesus’ name, amen.

Dear Sir,
We like to express our heartfelt gratitude and sincere appreciation for all that you have done for Singapore.
Like many others, we also belong to the generations who have not undergo much hardships or sufferings like our pioneers. Regretably, we only got to know you better now. Within the short five days of mourning, we learnt a lot – of how hard you had fought for the nation, the numerous intriguing & wise speeches you made, as well as the sentimental side of you.
You have definitely made enormous contributions to our society. Without you, we will not have this safe, beautiful, leading global city we called home.
Your wisdom & vision, along with endless determination & selflessness, have made Singapore a country we are all proud of. We are truly thankful beyond words…


Dear Sir, may you rest in peace. We will continue to be a good Singapore citizen and your legacy will be passed down to our children. We will remember you forever.

Yours sincerely,

Our founding father, your passing is a loss to Singapore – a land that you have lived, led and loved. A great leader, you selflessly led with your tenacity, foresight and brought this once little dot on the earth surface to a successful, thriving and prosperous world-known first class nation.
A strong advocate in equality, you strive for living together harmoniously in diversity, and reached out to everyone, regardless of race, language or religion. Your faith, persistence and great foresight during your reign still continue to benefit and allow us, your fellow Singaporeans, to reap benefits, from your sacrifice and labour.
My father once said,”Both your mother and I are lowly educated, yet we have a home to call our own, and two children who are educated and successful. We owe it to Mr Lee. He has contributed to a roof over our head, a stable ground for us to rely on in times of crisis, and he raised my children up well.”
A man of great strength and leadership in the political realm, you show us not just your love for Singapore, but also to your courage to display your tender loving care as a sentimental man to your late wife. Indeed, a sign of a man’s strength is how gently he loves his wife. I am deeply touched by how sweet and loving you are to the woman behind your back all these years – your very own pillar of support.
Just like how you celebrate the life of your late wife with your touching eulogy, we, your Singaporeans, your fellow countrymen and women, celebrate your life today.
Your contribution to Singapore can never be simply summed up in these few words and so does my gratitude to you. Without you, there will be no Singapore like today.
Thank you for gracing us with your lifetime.

Dear Mr Lee,
Few years ago, my family and I were living in Shanghai due to my husbands work. As a Singaporean living abroad, I kept connected to my homeland through constant updates on news and articles on the Internet.
As I see less and less of you in public appearances, I tell myself that should the day come, I will fly back home to personally send you off.
The good news is, my husband got posted back mid 2013 and it was a relief to be able to still catch you on TV a couple of times.
So on the first day of your lying in state. I was determined to go regardless of being told the arduous wait. As I was getting ready my 10 year old son said he wish to tag along, even though he knew the wait was 4 hours or more. I was touched. He asked me what to wear, I pondered for a while and told him to dress as if meeting Mr Lee in person. Without a word he dashed to his room and in few minutes came out in his suit which he wore for his solo guitar performance. I was totally stunned and asked him why he chose that attire. His reply was I quote “He was the Prime Minister! I have to look my best!” Trying hard to hold back my emotion, I told him it’s good that he thinks that way but we would be standing in the hot son for a while so will be too much to be in so many layers. Reluctantly he changed into something less formal, but still nothing short of long sleeves and long pants.
During the 4 hours wait, my son who is an iPad freak didn’t say a word about being bored, not even the slightest attempt to ask if he can use my iPhone to entertain himself. All he brought was a box of nerd candy, which he constantly poured a few every now n then to pop into his mouth.
When it was finally our turn, words can’t even describe the mixed feelings I had. Gratitude, admiration, sadness, emptiness, all filled me up in that short 30 seconds we stood in front of your coffin. As I choked up we bowed and said our goodbyes.


Mr Lee thank you again for all that you have done, we will miss you dearly, you will live in our hearts forever.
May you rest in peace.

This week, Singapore declared a national week of mourning.
This week, Singapore was deeply saddened by your passing.
This week, hundreds of thousands of Singaporeans formed the longest queue along Singapore River and Padang to pay tribute to you.
But to me,
This week marks a celebration of your life.
This week is an awakening week for the younger generation to understand how you have transformed Singapore from nothing to everything that we take for granted.
This week, our hearts are truly connected as One, the people are united as One.
This week marks the most remarkable and impactful week for Singapore in 2015.
No single SG50 celebration event can be as meaningful as this week.
I was born in 1965 and I am proud to be part of Singapore’s growth, and to be able to witness the transformation of Singapore as well.
No words can express my gratitude to you, dear Founding Father. THANK YOU.
You will be deeply missed and dearly cherished in our hearts for years…
Prayers to PM Lee and family.

Thank you, Mr Lee, for making Singapore a success – for sowing the seeds and ploughing the land so that we, the following generations, are able to enjoy the shade and the fruits those trees bear. And it is probably fitting to say so seeing how you were a firm believer in turning Singapore into a city in a garden. We are, without a doubt, extremely fortunate to have been blessed with a group of founding fathers who managed to turn Singapore into a modern miracle through sheer tenacity, logic and foresight, and all that Singapore has become is definitely the result of their hard work.
Thank you, Mr Lee, for inspiring the following generations to follow in your footsteps and keep pushing Singapore to greater heights, for we know that this country that you’ve built on all your life is capable of even more.
Thank you, Mr Lee, for this country that I can proudly call home. Your contributions to this nation will never, and can never, be forgotten. Even after many generations, we would still be remembering the humble beginnings of this fishing village, and through it all, the mastermind of a modern metropolis.
Thank you, Mr Lee, for all that you’ve dedicated your life to. May you rest in peace.

Dear Mr Lee
I first came to Singapore in 1989 for my first job after leaving my hometown in Ipoh. Since then, I never looked back. I admire the values and principles that you integrate in your administration of the nation. The fairness and equality of each citizens regardless of race, religion, background, etc….To me, Singapore is Lee Kuan Yew and Lee Kuan Yew is Singapore. I cannot imagine a Singapore without you.
At times, I envy the people of Singapore for having you as their leader. I admire your passion, and your desire, grit and determination to make Singapore a better place to live in; a place you can call home. You lived simply but with a big heart!
I am truly glad that I get to live in a Singapore with your presence for more than two decades. You will be missed but your spirit will continue to motivate the people of Singapore to continue growing this nation that you have built with your life.
Thank you Mr Lee Kuan Yew, thank you for Singapore. You have done remarkably well, beyond words can described.
Happy reunion with your wife and rest in peace Sir!
H. Wong


I am extremely grateful to Sir Lee Kuan Yew. I wouldn’t be where I am and my family wouldn’t be where we are, if not for Sir Lee Kuan Yew’s forward-looking policies.
My father chose to make Singapore his home because he felt this is where his children will get the best education with no fear of cultural dilution since Singapore is strongly rooted in Asian values. My father used to say and still says, Lee Kuan Yew has made this place a land of opportunity – you must work really hard and make the most of every opportunity you get. He has made Singapore a place where anyone can reach their true potential. This is not true in most countries across the world. You must respect this and be grateful for what you have received. You must create so much value in whatever work you do that Singapore is proud of you.
Sir Lee Kuan Yew, your governance standards, your policies, your speeches, your personality, your contribution, your life, was, is and shall be an inspiration and example for many generations to come.
My family and I thank you for being who you were.
May God bless your soul and grant you eternal peace and rest.

Dear Mr Lee,
I belong to the generation that got to enjoy the luxury of everything that you did and still, get to see you, pay my utmost and final respect to you and together with all Singaporeans, joined you on your last journey with us. No words can explain how fortunate I am, how grateful and how blessed I am to be a part of this. Nothing could change what you mean to Singaporeans. We Singaporeans will always remember you.


Writing this is the only thing that I can do to show how much I really appreciate as a Singaporean. There is nothing that we can do to be worth comparing to everything that you’ve given up for us. It is not even comparable to 0.01% of what you did for us. We’re eternally grateful and we’ll never be able to repay what you’ve done. It is only apt that we follow your values, pass it on and keep Singapore going. Because that’s the only thing that we can do and we’ll still be indebted to you.

There’re still so much more I needed to learn about Singapore’s history. I never had been through what my grandparents did. Despite not being able to witness your fights and rallies from the start, I’m still thankful as I can read all of these from the books – because of our wonderful education system. And I know that you did so much for us. I will study them and keep all these in my heart and pass it on to my future generations.

Thank you for building Singapore to where we are now. We’ll never be where we are without you. Maybe at your last moments, you were still pinning about Singapore. But we Singaporeans will definitely hold up to your values and ensure that we’ll have SG100, SG150, SG200 and definitely more to come.

We know that, noYEWnoUS. We’ll stay yew-nited as one. Cause we know that we’ll fall if we’re divided. Thank you for your determination and perseverance and believing in Singapore. Your dedication to the nation we call home is immeasurable and you’ll continue to live as a legacy in the hearts of all Singaporeans for generations to come. No amount of gratitude could explain how thankful I am for all your contributions, incredible foresights and diligence that let us to a thriving cosmopolitan country. Please continue to watch over Singapore. We’ll do you proud.

Farewell to the Singapore’s father, goodbye to our 阿公. Till we meet again, some day some how. May your soul rest in peace.

You toiled for our homeland, led the people through turbulent times. You fought for independence for the people, built a nation when there was none and gave us an identity.
Without you, we will never have the chance to celebrate National Day on 9 August, sing our own national anthem and recite our own pledge.
Through your vision, leadership, determination and passion, you have successfully put a hardly visible little red dot called Singapore on the global map in less than 50 years.
You gave us not only a country but a nation, a home that we are proud of. You made sure everyone has a home to live in, gave us education, built schools, provided us with Total Defence, ensuring that our children are well brought-up in a safe environment. You instilled responsibility in every one of us that we are responsible to protect our own loved ones and assets. You gave us a multi-racial society, where everyone here is equal.
I am proud to tell my foreign friends that I am not just a Chinese man.
I AM A SINGAPOREAN.
Thank you MR LEE KUAN YEW for your lifelong contributions. You gave your life for the people. Your legacy will live forever, the future generations will know of your wonderful work.
May you rest in peace.

Thank you Mr Lee Kuan Yew!
Thank you for your love and dedication for Singapore. I feel so blessed to have you with us, walking so closely with Singapore each and every day of your life. With your meticulous planning and consideration, you had paved a beautiful landscape for our nation. I really love the greenery on our sunny island! Since young, one of my favourite campaigns is “Tree Planting Day” in November. I always find it especially meaningful. With one man to plant a tree, many will do the same. Years after years, Singapore has eventually beautified herself with more flora and fauna. Thank you!
You had inspired me in many ways! For many unpleasant events that had happened in the past, you had forgiven many and even made friends with them. I’ve learnt from you on what you had shared- “Be diligent. Keep learning ongoing! 勤奋好学。活到老，学到老。Never neglect the needy。Forward Looking! Let action speaks louder than words!” I’ll surely plant them deep rooted in my heart and will work towards them. Thank you!
With your basic belief in values of respect, honesty, integrity and sincerity, you had genuinely touched and transformed so many lives in Singapore and around the world. I am definitely moved by your sincerity and frankness on how you had dealt with each problem in a realistic perspective. You were indeed an extraordinary leader who had led and cared for your people in Singapore. When you said “I am accountable for my people..” , it had truly moved me to tears. Thank you!
I admired your faith and courage. Your faith to believe Singapore will make it! Your courage to make things happen- in making a successful and prosperous Singapore! Thank you for spending a lifetime of yours for us and our nation. Thank you!
This is my little promise- as a humble educator, I will strive to do my very best to make Singapore’s next generation to take pride as a Singaporean! To share with them the important values in life.


You had made a great difference in our lives and we are extremely grateful for what you had done for us! Thank you!
We will continue to stay strong and move on with courage. FORWARD TOGETHER SINGAPORE!
THANK YOU Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
Yours Sincerely,
with a true Singaporean love,

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
In a world where so much is promised but so little delivered, you stand out for delivering so much with so little at your disposal. Singapore owes you a debt of eternal gratitude.


Thank you sir, and farewell.
Edwin Yeoh

Dear Sir,
Thank you for everything that you have done for this country, and her people. I am fortunate to have been born into the time where people were enjoying the fruits of our forefathers’ labours under your leadership and guidance. Because of your vision and your team’s efforts, our people can enjoy the comforts that perhaps sometimes we forget are not a given, but are the results of decades of hardwork during an era unknown to those of us who did not experience it. Thank you for everything you have contributed to Singapore in your lifetime.


Even at your passing, some years after you left the public office, you continue to give Singapore and its people an important lesson – a lesson on unity. That it is possible for a nation to come together, no matter who we are to achieve something together. The number of people, from all walks of lives, coming together for one sole reason of paying their last respects to you, is testament to this, and more importantly, how much we appreciate and love you for all that you have done. I only hope we will not disappoint you and our forefathers, and will continue to bring brightness and glory to the legacy you have left behind.

Rest in peace Sir, as you are united once again with the love of your life. My deepest condolences goes to PM Lee and his family as he and our nation go through this time of grief over your loss.

With a grateful heart,
Pingshan Huang

I was born in 1997 and had never gotten the chance to meet Mr Lee Kuan Yew, yet his legacy was well known throughout the country. It is really regretful that Mr Lee passed away in the year of Singapore’s golden jubilee but have faith that he is in a peaceful place now and looking over SIngapore fondly.


Even though I heard in the morning that Mr Lee had passed away, the significance did not really hit me as hard until I went to school and suddenly realise that our founding father has passed away. Even though he ended his Prime Minister service before I was born, even though I’ve never actively interacted with a great man like him before – a real pity actually – yet tears welled in my eyes and I never knew I could feel so much for a man I’ve never met.

But even though he’s a man I’ve never met, he’s THE man who built all I have today. Clean water and sanitation, education, housing, a green country; the successes of Singapore were all brought by Mr Lee.

It was really heartbreaking to see Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong during his speech announcing the death of his father. It must be really hard on him and I send my condolences.

Our Singapore spirit shines brightly throughout during this mourning period. Many queued to pay their respects and some made unique tributes for the late Mr Lee. I hope that from where Mr Lee is now, he can see what he built coming together and glowing as a country.

We grieve as a nation for the loss of a great man. We grieve as a nation for the loss of a father.

Yet, we eternally honour, respect and send our greatest gratitude for he who have sacrificed his whole life for us and the Singapore he has built today.

May you rest in peace forever, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, we will do our best to sustain your legacy, we are proud Singaporeans. Koh Su En

Dear Sir,
Thank you for your remarkable leadership, your guiding presence and your fierce, fierce passion that has been and now will forever be a legacy for the children of tomorrow.


Thank you for believing in the little red dot, the countless thoughts you’ve put into your red box.

A lot of us indeed have a lot to reflect because we were born enjoying the fruits of our forefathers’ labour.

May you and Mrs. Lee still be ever proud of Singapore ten, fifty years down the road when our home’s a 100 years into independence.

Thank you for reminding us that the way through hard times is neither about size nor force but passion, hardwork, love and resilience.

I’ve always believed that the nation is a human construct – but it is indeed the work of great people that make a great nation possible, so thank you for your great leadership and for steering Singapore when it was at its darkest hour.

Last but not least, my sincerest condolences to PM Lee and the family of Mr. Lee Kuan Yew. Thank you for your understanding and patience as the nation mourns in harmony. Your loss is incomparable to ours. Sow Jeng Yi

《巨人》
——写于建国总理李光耀出殡日——
依旧是新加坡的天空
星云下景象变样
曾经，是一个小小渔港，商业寥寥
曾经，是一家数口、挤一个租来的小房间
曾经，为了生活 ，工人罢工、小贩逃避地牛
曾经，是红毛先生太太打高尔夫、喝下午茶的东方天堂。。。。
。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。
终于，来了，来了
震天的呼唤：
Merdeka! Merdeka! Merdeka!
巨人高举理想的旗帜
引领团队，穿街走巷，
广播演讲，家家户户动员
追求一个唯一的目标：
建立新加坡、国家繁荣，人民幸福！
。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。
依旧是新加坡的天空
星云下景象变样
新加坡模式创造一个又一个奇迹——
从此，混浊的母亲河清冽干净，
运货的舯舡让道给观景游船
斑驳的货仓改建银行、商业大楼和公寓
光鲜白领接替苦力登场。
从此， “居者有其屋”，大家都有房子
不再忍受包租人的脸色。
从此，不必担惊怕险、因为没有种族挤压：
马来、印度、中华、西方，相互渗透滋养
绽放多元和谐共长的新加坡拉（Singapura）文化。
从此，红白的五星国旗日下辉映
民主，和平，进步，公正，平等
迎着风飘扬、飘扬。。。
。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。
是他，是他，是他——。
一个时代的巨人凭着
独立的卓见和坚持
无私的责任和纪律
在国际上狮吼
缔造新加坡的精神
谱写国家治理新章
硕大了地图上的小红点
让新加坡
像朝天椒那样俏红热辣
小个体大能量
赢得世界最大的尊敬！

Dear Sir,
I never got to meet you but I am reminded and left in awe of your legacy each corner I turn. Born and raised in Singapore, a Sikh and part of a minority group, I never felt marginalized in any way growing up and even got to take my mother tongue, Punjabi, at A-level. This is your life’s work – ensuring your people of Singapore worked towards a wonderful quality of life despite
all odds being against us.


Your lessons imparted are indelible and your life’s achievement immeasurable.
Rest well and may Singapore never squander your legacy but instead build upon the very strong foundations you devoted your life towards building.

Thank you always.
Love,
Navleen

Our Founding Father Mr Lee Kuan Yew♡
Dear Mr Lee,


Thank you so much. If it wasn’t for you, Singapore wouldn’t be here as it is right now. It was heart wrenching when I heard that you had passed away. I remember me and many classmates crying or having tears well up in our eyes when my teacher showed us a clip. The clip was about your past and it also showed the strong love you had between you and your wife. My teacher cried too, but she didn’t want us to see her cry that she walked in and out of the classroom multiple times.
I remember our principle asking all students to recite the pledge proud and loud. After your passing, I heard more information or stories about your past that I never knew.
I would like to thank you many for giving us racial harmony, education and housing estates. Thank you for letting me be proud to be a Singaporean, feel safe to be in Singapore. With National Service and our own armed military, it makes me feel safe no matter where I go.
You were not obliged to help or build up Singapore yet you did. I cannot express the gratitude all Singaporeans feel for what you have done.
Chiang Jia Qi

Dear Mr Lee,
I did not expect the kind of emotions that would be stirred up in me with your passing but I found myself heavy-hearted over the course of this week after news broke of your departure. I was born in the 80s and by then, many structures and systems implemented by you were already in place.


As speeches made by you from the early years of Singapore were televised these last couple of days, I realised that you were indeed a visionary and your foresight was remarkable. You saw the potential that Singapore could become and you toiled and gave your blood, sweat and tears to make us a success story.

Some detractors may not have agreed with your ways but I, along with many other Singaporeans recognise and understand that it was necessary for you to do what you did and make the hard decisions so that Singapore could survive the difficult and tumultuous years, and then after that progress and excel as a nation. You represented Singapore on the international stage and made us a force to be reckoned with, a miracle for a little red dot.

I respect you for walking the talk on both the personal and public fronts. Many recounted of your deep love for your wife and you demonstrated what “”till death do us part”” truly meant.

Where others gave rousing speeches and then fail to deliver when given the opportunity, you made sure that you upheld such high levels of integrity and moral standards for yourself so that Singaporeans knew they could trust and believe in you. When we did place our trust in you, you took it seriously and made good on your promises.

Thank you for giving your life to Singapore and your love for Singaporeans. I am truly grateful.
Serene T

Dear Mr Lee,
My very first memory of you was seeing you in Parliament on Ch8’s news. You were always in a white shirt with either a blue or black jacket. I was too young to then to know who you are, that you were debating about things that helped me become who I am today.


I just want to say, “”Thank you””. Thank you for doing what is right, what is needed and not what is popular. Thank you for your undying sense of responsibility towards us. Thank you bringing together us together.

One of the things I always find hard to explain to friends from other countries was our unique blend of culture. After all, we are a country made up of immigrants. “”Singapore? What’s your race? Chinese? Then are you from China? Is that friend from India?”” Common questions that they ask. They don’t know we have all called Singapore home, that we have accepted each other’s differences and bonded. To quote something I heard on TV, “”I always introduce myself as Singaporean. Not an Indian or a Singapore Indian. I’m just a Singaporean.””

Most importantly, Mr Lee, thank you for giving me a place I can call home, a place where I don’t have to worry about when my next meal will be, a place where I can fret over frivolous stuff, a place where I can actually decide between chasing my passion or earning money (versus survival or starve).

I’m not good at saying goodbyes. I’ll miss looking out for you during NDP. Sometimes, I feel lost when I think that you are not here anymore. To quote PM Lee, “”..when he’s there, you know you will be alright, that everything will be okay, you will get through it.”” I wish I had paid more attention to watch those Parliament highlights as a kid.

Thank you.
Cheers,
Huishan

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew
My utmost respect to you and a bigger than big thank you to you. *please accept my bow to you


You have given us a safe country, a beautiful big garden city, a friendly passport and a reputable citizenship. You gave us Home.

To do this, you truly possess the best talent and patience. Trust that “”People”” are the most difficult beings to deal with and rather challenging at most of the time because of individual differences. But despite all these, you manage to put these people as one, to build this one nation and this one Singapore.

Since young, when I sing the national songs, it always gives me a blessed feeling and I must say I Love Singapore and am lucky to be a Singapore Citizen. Thank God for he place me in this country and in your good care.

Today, listening to the same songs again, it gave a deeper meaning. In these songs, they seems to be converying your messages to us. And in fact, all of us learnt these songs and heard these messages at a very young age and till we grow old~

With you leaving and going to a better place, your messages will stay. You stay in our hearts forever and your teachings to us will go on and last forever.

Sing with me ~ Count on me Singapore
—————————————————–

We have a vision for tomorrow,

Just believe, just believe
We have a goal for Singapore,

we can achieve, we can achieve
You and me, we’ll do our part,

stand together, heart to heart
We’re going to show the world

what Singapore can be
We can achieve, we can achieve

Count on me Singapore,

count on me Singapore
Count on me to give my best and more,

count on me Singapore

———————————

You are Singapore Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

I will do my part as a Singapore citizen and to grow the country within my limited capacity.

Endless thoughts and a lifetime of gratitude.

Rest in peace Mr Lee Kuan Yee and may you be a very bless in your after-life.

Love from Jessie GOH YX

Dear Mr Lee,
I just want to say thank you for all you have done for us. I really appreciate everything you have done so that we, Singaporeans, have a vibrant, beautiful place to live in, as well as ensuring that Singapore is one of the safest countries ever. Thank you for transforming Singapore from a fishing village to a garden city. We started from the bottom, and here we are, thanks to you. You dedicated your entire life so that we could have a successful Singapore and I am so thankful for that.


It’s a privilege to live and grow up in Singapore, and I am very grateful for what you have done so that we could have clean water, proper affordable housing, and a peaceful, safe environment. I am also thankful with how easy we are able to travel from one place to another, thanks to the MRT, LRT and public buses.

Thanks to you, I am proud to be a Singaporean. Studying abroad and having people react so positively after hearing that I am from Singapore and saying how much they loved Singapore gave me a huge sense of pride for Singapore.

“This is home, surely, as my senses tell me
This is where I won’t be alone, for this is where I know it’s home”

Thank you for making Singapore a better place, for making Singapore a place I am so proud to call home, and a home I miss when I am abroad.

Thank you for being such an inspiration, with your selflessness, devotion, perseverance, great leadership and more.

You will always be in our hearts. Rest in peace.
With love,
Faith C.

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
Thanks for all the things you’ve done for Singapore with your entire life. All the things you’ve done for our country Singapore will be appreciate by our fellows Singaporeans. You will be missed and remembered by all of us even though you’re gone but still stays in our heart.


“”At the end of the day, what have i got? A successful Singapore. What have i given up? My life.”” “”As long as i’m in-charge, nobody is going to knock it down.”” All these words said by you will always be remember in our heart. Am i more proud to be a Singaporean with such a nice built country with all your hard work. Rest in peace sir, I hope you have already reunited with your beloved wife. It’s sad that you can’t witness SG50 with our fellow Singaporeans and watch Singapore turn 50 this year but I really hope you can watch Singapore grow in heaven sir. You’ve been a great role model for everybody. Thank god for giving us such a good person to build Singapore for us! No words could express my gratitude towards you Mr Lee. Hope you’re doing good up there. Condolence to Mr Lee’s family and thanks for sharing such a great father with our dear Singaporeans. You will be love Mr Lee, Founding father of Singapore.
Rest in peacefully and thank you, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Staniel Han.

A TRIBUTE TO MR LEE KUAN YEW


In life, Mr Lee Kuan Yew tried to unite the nation and Singaporeans of different colours, cultures and creeds. In death, the nation and Singaporeans from all walks of life unite to honour him.

Tears is a universal language we all can understand; and the outpouring of grief and sadness of Singaporeans from all walks of life tells deeply of what is in our hearts; it a testament of how much Mr Lee Kuan Yew is being loved and respected, and will be deeply and greatly missed.

Whilst we grieve and mourn a great and irreplaceable loss of Mr Lee Kuan Yew to the nation, we also celebrate the immeasurable gain that this great and gifted legendary leader-statesman has brought to millions in Singapore by his deep affection, devotion, commitment and love for Singapore and Singaporeans

Singapore and Singaporeans are truly blessed.

Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s legacy is immortalized in this city-state, for as long as Singapore continues in history.

We salute you, Sir, for serving Singapore and Singaporeans – and the global community – with such total dedication and devotion, conviction and commitment to a cause at your cost, with your very best till the very last.

A good name / reputation is more desirable than great riches; and being highly esteemed is better than silver or gold [Proverbs 22:1]

God bless you.
Tan Choon Seng

Dedicated to the man whom some of us affectionately call “”ah gong”” :)


Dear Mr Lee,

Thank you for giving us (the younger/future generations) such a wonderful and safe place to live in! Its heartwarming seeing sporeans (young and old, regardless of race or religion) queueing up side by side, patiently waiting in line just to bid farewell to you. Whats 4hrs (now 10hrs) of wait compared to the years of hard work and commitment you had put in for us.

Its saddens me to know you were still working for this country right till the very last moment, before you were hospitalized. For us, you never took a break. I will never forget this quote of urs : At the end of the day, what have I got? A successful Singapore. What have I given up? My life.”” Thank you ah gong, for your vision, your foresight, your wisdom, your leadership and your sacrifices.

Without you, Singapore wldnt be what it is today. This place which I fondly call home, is the fruit of your hard work! Mr Lee, I just wanted to let you know that ive always been proud to be a Singaporean :) & you have and will always be someone whom I look up to!

I don’t think we can ever thank you enough for all the things you had done for us. It may be unspoken by the younger generations. But the scene i saw while queueing is evidence of the love and respect we (Singaporeans of age) have for you. You have once again united us as one people one nation one Singapore. We are truly honoured and blessed to have a great man like you leading us.

Ah gong, we will definitely miss your presence 

May you rest in peace our dearest Mr Lee.

With love & respect,
JM Tan

Dear Mr Lee,
These are my heartfelt words:


As part of the younger generation in Singapore, I am fortunate enough to be born into a Singapore that is already flourishing. We live comfortably with a roof above our heads. We receive fresh running water at the turn of the tap. We are able to receive world class education regardless of race or religion. We are able to dream, and to create a future that we own.

Little do we know that sometimes, we do have a tendency to take things for granted. To speak for myself, it is easy to forget how far we have come. These past few days, it had finally dawned upon me that what I am enjoying right now does not come easy. It came at a price and that price is bore by a man who cared – Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

Mr Lee, it is because you care that you dedicated your entire life to building Singapore. It is because you care that you implemented some unpopular, but necessary, policies. You had our best interests at heart. And it is because you care that even though you were criticised by many, you continue to trudge on.

Your love for the nation extends far beyond what the public is able to see. It is because you care that even till the very last day before you were hospitalised that you still continued working with the contents in the “”red box””, trying to better the country we are all living in. It was perhaps because you knew that you do not have much time left that you want to spend the remaining of your time doing all that you can for Singapore.

No monument or statue can ever represent the legacy you have left us with. Just look around and what we see around us is a testament of what you have achieved. Even though you may not be physically here with us, you will continue to live in our hearts. Your work has not ended but has only just begun. It is now in the hands of the new generation of Singaporeans to continue doing what Mr Lee has started. It is now in my hands to build Singapore into what you have envisioned it to be.The journey ahead may not be smooth-sailing but so long as Singaporeans unite together, it is a future we can achieve.

Lastly, from deep within my heart, I just want to thank you once again for caring. Unconditionally.

Remembering you always,
Moo Lee Yin

Dear Mr Lee,
Thank you for everything you had done for Singapore. No number of words will be sufficient to express our gratitude to you. You had built a country which we are proud to call home.


I belong to the late 70’s generation, a generation which never really experience much hardships. Standard of living in Singapore had improved much by then and it continues to improve.

When I was born, my grandparents and parents are already staying in HDB flats. Clean water is a matter of turning on the taps. Lights, TV and air con are just about switches and remote controls. Education is about which school to go to depending on results, not about availability or affordability. Job opportunities are equal between genders, capability is the key. My red Singapore passport allows me to travel across most part of the globe easily. This week that I am reminded that all the economic stability, national security and harmony, day-to-day safety, comfort of life, high level of education, equal job opportunities, all that we have taken for granted, did not come easy.

All these are achieved because you have dedicated your life to building Singapore. Your tireless contributions and your great foresight ensure that Singapore is built on a strong foundation. All these cannot be taken for granted and I pray that the many generations after will not forget this too. Thank you Mr Lee.

May you rest in peace knowing that you are dearly missed and that all your lifetime hard works will not be forgotten.

Dear Mr Lee,
Thank you for your many years of dedication and love that brought Singapore to what it is today. When Singapore was a baby, you nurtured her, gave her love and strengthen her. Like any father, you fought off things and people that you think were harmful to her. In the end, you harmonized everything within her.


When she was young, you gave her guidance. You believe education was key for her and provided for her. You wanted her to have strong values and principles, not easily influenced by western cultures. You taught her that she must always do things well and efficiently and that would increase her productivity.

Throughout the years, you guided her and strengthened her so that she would not be bullied or taken advantage of by her neighbors. But, at the same time, you build strong relationships with them.

As a proud parent, you worked hard to put her on the international stage, promoting her values and strength so that people would have confidence and trust in her.

Even at times when she started to stray, you were always there to bring her back in line. Singapore had progressed immensely under your love and care and is world renowned even though she is so small in size.
Words can never be enough to thank you for your dedication and sacrifices.

Now that you have left us, we are deeply saddened, But being the pragmatic leader that you are, the more appropriate way that we can honor you is to continue your legacy, excelling in everything that we do and making Singapore the very best in the world.

Thank you, Father of Singapore…..
Resi in Peace….Your legacy will live on for generations to come…..

Dearest Mr Lee,
I was born in the early seventies. A time when Singapore was still trying to establish her foothold, economically and structurally. There were many policies introduced by the government I did not understand as a young boy, such as the “Stop at Two” sterilisation campaign, compulsory conscription for National Service, and so on. I am not politically inclined, nor have I been a fervent advocate of all your actions without question, but it is with a heavy and embarrassed heart, I admit I am only beginning to realise your raison d’être following your earthly departure.


Forty years on, as I type out this tribute message within a HDB house I can call my own, I have come to understand the reasons behind most of your decisions, and why you chose to do what you had to for a nation that has to maintain and defend its existence with its own devices. There are many detractors who condemn your policies. They blame the current influx of foreign workers on the “Stop at Two” initiative. Truth be told, I am xenophobic in some ways, but people must understand how the booming population in the late sixties might overburden the economy in the years to follow, and even if we had the local numbers now, would Singaporeans be willing to take up blue collar jobs with meagre salaries?

I did not particularly enjoy my years in the army. Being away from loved ones was the biggest challenge. In hindsight, however, I do look back on my time in National Service with great fondness; the tough training which shaped me both physically and mentally, the friends I’ve made, the jokes we’ve shared, and the inextricable bonds forged which NS men who have served can attest to. More importantly, your decision to enlist our young men to defend our country was never a misstep. We can’t look to our neighbours or even the United Nations for aid. We must defend what we have. A land you helped to build with your tireless and dedicated team of pioneers.

I spent hours over the past few days watching footages of your rallies and National Day speeches, as well as interviews with people you’ve worked with over the decades. And it is only in doing so, that I have come to realise the amount of effort and dedication you’ve contributed to Singapore, things which I have taken for granted. I knew you had a hand in nurturing our garden city, but I didn’t know you gave personal instructions to beautify the spaces beneath our viaducts and the sides of overhead bridges with flora. Little things like that. You were constantly racking your brains on how to make Singapore self-sufficient where our water supply is concerned. You cared about this from the beginning, back in the sixties shortly after our independence from Malayan rule. And we have to thank you for the NEWater recycling project, potable water, and the clean city we live in today.

You will always be remembered as a fiery and influential orator to me. A loving husband and a doting father. A man who didn’t mince his words, squander his time, nor sympathise with his adversaries. A no-nonsense individual who gave his all for his nation, and who did everything in his power to ensure her stability and prosperity. We will miss you and your leadership, Mr Lee, as we prepare to build a new tomorrow in the knowledge and trust that you will always be looking over us as a guiding light. Rest in everlasting peace.
Sim Hock Chye Andy

Dear Sir,
I have never put serious thought into my nationality all my life – singing national day songs out of occasion, singing the national anthem in school, going through national education and so on, just because. I knew it was important to stay loyal to one’s country, but I never truly understood that sense of belonging a patriotic citizen will have, more accurately depicted in the Chinese saying “ai guo jing shen”.


But on Monday, it hit me how truly proud I am, and I should be, to be a Singaporean. Even from miles away, the grief hit hard; it was real. I guess I would never be able to feel the same intensity of emotions people from my parents and grandparents’ generations would feel, but your passing felt like a personal loss. I wish I did have the privilege to see you even once in person, but sadly I cant, even at this juncture, to say my last goodbye.

As a 21 year old who hasn’t experienced as much, I’m probably in no position for my thoughts to matter much, but like any other Singaporean from my generation who has been incredibly blessed to have been able to benefit so much from your contributions, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. No amount of words can express the respect I have for you, for sacrificing your life, heart and soul into building our nation. And you never stopped even after you stepped down – you’ve taught me the meaning of true love. To your family, and to your country.

Your capabilities as a leader were unquestionably outstanding, with your incredible foresight and ability in bringing people together as one to have the same vision. But what impacts on me the most was how you fought for your beliefs, no matter how difficult and impossible the situation seemed to be. You lived life to the fullest, with the spirit of “never-say-die” even when you faced so many tribulations at the beginning. Your verve for life and resilience will always, always inspire me and many others. You have been selfless to the very end, and without you Singapore wouldn’t have been able to be what she is today. You are truly admirable, not only as a leader but as a person.

I have been very fortunate, being born with a roof over my head, not having to worry about food, school, and I received excellent education in Singapore my entire life. Going abroad for my university education has made me cherish the littlest things that Singapore has – the accessibility, transport, education, safety and so much more, things that many take for granted everyday. You’ve played a major role in building Singapore into what it is today, and even though it isn’t perfect, it is genuine, real and a testament of hard work and sincerity. Thanks to you, kids like me are able to receive quality education and enjoy the superb living aspects Singapore has to offer even though we’re just a tiny red dot.

You have always brought Singapore together, both in your presence and absence, the first time you stepped up as our leader and even when you left.

Thank you for everything you’ve done for Singapore. No words will ever adequately express how thankful we are / I am for all the sacrifices you’ve made for us, but we’ll definitely strive to continue your legacy and do the best we can for our country, love and live life to the fullest, just like you did.

You’ll always be loved and remembered.
Rest in peace.

Yours Sincerely,
Amanda Tan W M

Dear Mr Lee
In the past week I see the whole nation come together to pay tribute to you showing their heartfelt appreciation, respect, admiration and love for our founding father. Thank you so much for your undying love, care and concern for us and made lives much better for us. You worked tirelessly everyday to make our lives better even up till 4th February 2015 before you were warded brings tears to my eyes. It is Singapore’s great fortune to have you and will be missed dearly. Thank you Mr Lee, may you rest in peace.

敬爱的国父李光耀先生，
对您的感激千言万语也道不尽。
衷心的感激您奉献您的一生让新加坡迈向成功。
您的贡献，我们将会永远铭记在心。
内心万分的悲痛，万分的不舍，
但愿您安息，勿挂念，一路走好。
您永远活在我们的心中，我们会很怀念您。

Dear Mr Lee,
First of all, I can only say thank you. Thank you so much for dedicating your life just so we can enjoy all the comforts that we live in now. Thank you for your unwavering faith in Singapore when everyone else told you otherwise. It is inspiring to see how someone can be so dedicated to a cause and to be able to do what is right, instead of what is popular.


I am 21 this year, born when Singapore was already a developed country. I have never been through the harsh war conditions that my grandparents had to go through, but I am ever so thankful for all that we have. Every single time I pass by the Singapore River and other iconic sites, I get reminded of how blessed I am to be here. I look at the highly subsidised school fees that we pay, the world class education that we get, the harmony between the different races, and the cleanliness of the city I live in, and I can’t help but to think of how lucky and privileged Singaporeans are. All these were made possible because of your unwavering faith in Singapore, never giving up even in the face of difficulties. You, Sir, are a blessing to Singapore.

Words cannot express how thankful I am to be here enjoying what you have built for us. I paid my respects at the Jurong community tribute centre today and, I quote from one of the volunteers, we are all sons and daughters of Singapore. We are lucky we had such a great “”father”” looking out for us, giving us his all, and doing what is the best for the country.

I am proud to be a Singaporean. It gives me a sense of warmth when I see the Singapore flag flying high and free every National Day. It reminds me that this freedom should never be taken for granted and we must never forget the hardships that the previous generations went through to achieve this independence. This is my home. I will fight to keep our flag flying high and free.

We may have lost you today, but your legacy lives on forever.
Thank you for making all this possible for us.

Thank you, Sir, for this place I proudly call home.
Iris Lim

Words seldom elude the normally prolific me. Yet I was wordless, and couldn’t pen anything even 3 days later, since the time I read of the inevitable finality from my end of the world (2 h after your passing).

It was heavy even to read news of the resilent ‘invincible’ Lee Kuan Yew lying critically ill in hospital. I was far more used to seeing our “”lion of leaders”” standing determinedly self-assured on the podium, proudly holding your own.

The name Lee Kuan Yew is synonymous with Singapore. A phenomenal “”Lion among Leaders”” who steered so wisely with such fine long-sighted vision and amazing foresight, despite all the seemingly insurmountable challenges when you took the helm.

Painstakingly mapping and reinforcing the strong foundations of basic infrastructure. Be it consistently strong focus on Education (including Bilingualism which has stood many of us in good multilingual stead), successful blending the melting-pot ‘rojak’ of seamless Multicultural harmony like no other I have seen, Safety, Health, Housing, bridging of East + West, instilling values of efficiency and productivity in our work ethic .. to name but some.
There were far too many challenges (and resulting sterling achievements to mention), yet you managed to steer us progressively to exceptional exemplary world-class standards in them all.

You have more than successfully carved, shaped and established an exceptional legacy – our tiny island-country Singapore; which has meteorically risen from the ‘castaway reject’ with no natural resources progressively forward to our current global standing and clout in 50 short years.

You reach beyond Singapore. The accolades pouring in from foreign dignitaries (some now your personal friends) are testimony of your admired extraordinary abilities, impressive diplomatic skills and remarkable contributions to Singapore.
The amazing efficiency with which Singaporeans reacted so quickly in response to the overwhelming crowds who showed up on the first day to say goodbye, is testimony to how we have been nurtured to problem solve so efficiently – you would have been proud of us, as well the SG solidarity reflected.

THANK YOU as always, from the bottom of my heart. For my education, my enriched colorful multicultural exposure, for blinding us to colour and instilling in us respectful racial equality and meritocracy; for allowing me the opportunity to explore and compare what a privileged existence and opportunities we actually have in Singapore.
It was a privilege for Singapore to have been gifted such a highly capable and exceptionally intelligent founding father in you; who also came armed with guts and steely determination to steer radically, in her bleakest of times.

May we always cherish the legacy and the life you dedicated to the cause, and stand always united as a nation.

R.I.P. sir. While regretful you will not be here to witness SG50, hope you are reunited with your beloved wife and soul mate. CONDOLENCES to the family, and thank you for sharing with us your father.

Proudly Singaporean always, regardless of whichever adopted country I happen to live or work in. Home will always be where the heart lies.

– Christine K

Dear Mr Lee,
No words can express the gratitude I felt towards you who made Singapore Mehta it is today.


A very big Thank You for the hard work you have put in together with the Old Guards. We are forever indebted to all of you for the things you have done for us.

I thank God for giving us a Lee Kuan Yew. A man of intelligence, foresight, astuteness and bravery. During a tumultuous time in our history, you came up, formed a party called PAP, and fight for your countrymen, for democracy, and equal rights, freeing us from the British and from Malaysia. Above all, you made such a great progress that we emerged from a Third World country to world Class metropolitan in a mere 30 years.

Without you, we would not have enjoyed the life we have today. I had a good education, I lived comfortably, I feel safe and secure, and I have a roof over my head.

Thank you for everything, for all the work that you have done for us.

You are a legend and your legacy will live on now and in the generations to come.

Thanks to you, I am proud to be a Singaporean and proud of my home country everywhere I go. I hold my pink NRIC and red passport with pride!

Rest in Peace Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
Gratefully Yours,Elizabeth Goh

I was born in 1997 and had never gotten the chance to meet Mr Lee Kuan Yew, yet his legacy was well known throughout the country. It is really regretful that Mr Lee passed away in the year of Singapore’s golden jubilee but have faith that he is in a peaceful place now and looking over SIngapore fondly.


Even though I heard in the morning that Mr Lee had passed away, the significance did not really hit me as hard until I went to school and suddenly realise that our founding father has passed away. Even though he ended his Prime Minister service before I was born, even though I’ve never actively interacted with a great man like him before – a real pity actually – yet tears welled in my eyes and I never knew I could feel so much for a man I’ve never met.

But even though he’s a man I’ve never met, he’s THE man who built all I have today. Clean water and sanitation, education, housing, a green country; the successes of Singapore were all brought by Mr Lee.

It was really heartbreaking to see Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong during his speech announcing the death of his father. It must be really hard on him and I send my condolences.

Our Singapore spirit shines brightly throughout during this mourning period. Many queued to pay their respects and some made unique tributes for the late Mr Lee. I hope that from where Mr Lee is now, he can see what he built coming together and glowing as a country.

We grieve as a nation for the loss of a great man. We grieve as a nation for the loss of a father.

Yet, we eternally honour, respect and send our greatest gratitude for he who have sacrificed his whole life for us and the Singapore he has built today.

May you rest in peace forever, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, we will do our best to sustain your legacy, we are proud Singaporeans.
Koh Su En

Dear Mr. Lee, the Bible tells us that Jesus said, “”Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one’s life for his friends. (John 15:13 NKJV). You have over many decades demonstrated your immeasurable love for Singapore and her people, serving them throughout your lifetime with excellence, integrity and passion.
The legacy that you left will no doubt carried on as our ministers and leaders embrace the moral principles of standards and service that you lived. You are truly God’s gift and blessing to our nation and will be sorely missed.


We as a people are deeply indebted to you for all that you have done in nurturing and caring for this nation that we can now call our home with pride. We can never thank you enough for being such a blessing, putting our nation’s interest first above all else.

In the course of serving my 28 years of service as a Reservist or NSMan as we were later renamed, I’ve had the pleasure and privilege of meeting 3 Presidents but if there is one regret, it is that I never had the opportunity to meet you and personally thank you for your passion and love for Singapore.

Before those reading this message get the impression that I’m just a “”yes”” man, on the contrary I’ve taken exception to some policies and have given feedback through the appropriate channels. I’m just someone who appreciates an honest man, an exceptional leader and someone that is worthy of honor, admiration and the utmost respect.

Even my daughter who is completing her education overseas wrote a moving note on her Facebook page to thank you. I didn’t expect it but you have inspired and influenced the younger generation as well such is your impact.

With a humble heart and the heartfelt gratitude of my entire household, thank you!

Finally, in your words, “”Merdaka! Majulah Singapura!””
Thank you Founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew.From Vincent, Genevieve and Beth

Back in the days when I just started my clinical attachment in SGH as a student nurse, I was really lucky meet Mr. Lee Kuan Yew by coincidence.


We were having our facility tour in SGH and someone shouted “”VIP coming, clear your ways please””. Being clueless and nosy year 1 student nurses we were stretching our necks to see who is this VIP that we have to clear our ways for him. Then it was your appearance, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew. I can feel the switch of atmosphere at your charismatic appearance as you slowly walked towards our direction. All I can think about that moment was “”Wow. No. Joke.””
However, that tense atmosphere only last for a moment when you opened your mouth and started greeting us, smiling and waving. I was so welcomed by how down to earth you are; approaching these bunch of student nurses, well-wishing us as future nurses and even shaking some of our hands.
And few years later, on 23/3/15, I came upon the news that you have passed away in SGH where I now worked as a full time Staff nurse. In fact, I was on night shift that exact day. I am overwhelmed by this unexplainable mixed feeling.

Spending almost 13 years of my life in Singapore where I first came for my studies has certainly given me opportunities to broaden my horizons. Being trilingual is one of the strength points I have achieved from Singapore’s education system, which is one of your legacy. I can proudly say that my parents have chosen the right country, Singapore for my studies, where I call it my second home.

I once went one of village in less developed country for voluntary service trip. Experiencing their condition of living, I remember my friend and I were jokingly saying what this country needs right now was “”Lee Kuan Yew””.
Singapore is really fortunate to have someone so passionate towards his country. Someone who sacrificed his whole life in building up this country from none to prosperous cosmopolitan lion city, without you Singapore would not be what it is now today.
I truly respect and admire what you have done and what you achieved for this country.

Thousands of people from all over the world are lamenting your absence, we are all grateful for what you have done. I am paying my last respects to you. Thank you Mr Lee, you will be deeply missed. God bless and rest in peace. 一路好走.
Kim Yoon Jung

I was born the middle of 1980s, a generation that has only heard about your legacy through stories. As a child of two long serving police officers, I was naturally raised to many such stories of great respect and admiration for what you have done for the country. Yet despite these stories there was always this disconnect. Perhaps as development in countries is often accompanied by issues with pollution and haze, Singapore’s elevated status from third world to first world has too brought on a haze of apathy, false sense of entitlement and a tendency to critique and complain rather than affirm and appreciate.


Today, the heavens opened as we lined the streets to bid you farewell and with the rain I sensed and felt an awakening. An awakening perhaps most keenly felt by my generation, an awakening that had been stirring in the countless personal sharings on Facebook, in words and more importantly in actions of millions of Singaporeans taking time to come together to mourn your passing.

Today the haze that has plagued my generation has cleared, today we stand united and convicted in our Singaporean identity, today we will remember for the rest of our lives as the day our Singapore stood together to be counted and promised the world that we will continue your legacy.

So thank you Mr Lee, thank you for once again reuniting and invigorating our nation even as the final chapter of your life comes to a close, may your soul rest in peace and your legacy live on forever in our hearts.
Mervyn Lek

I have always admired Mr. Lee Kuan Yew’s superb leadership, his strong conviction, his exemplary discipline, his absolute disgust for corruption and his unwavering dedication to give his best for this small island nation.


These are the qualities of a great leader and he has fully demonstrated what a true leader really looks like.

He has the set the bar very high for all of us Singaporeans to aspire to.

It truly saddens me that we have lost such a great leader but such a loss should propel us Singaporeans to even greater heights.

What Lee Kuan Yew and his A-team colleagues has shown is that if you truly put your mind into your goal, you can achieve it regardless of the odds that is stacked against you.

Let us Singaporeans remember that what we have achieved is not done without sweat and blood. It has taken a generation of selfless leaders to bring us where we are now. Let’s don’t take our achievement for granted. Let’s be grateful and build on the legacy of our founding fathers of modern Singapore. Let’s reflect on our own actions and collectively strive for a better future for this and the next generation.

Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, we will remember you as we celebrate our nation’s 50th anniversary this year. You may not be with us to celebrate what should rightfully be a celebration of your lifetime achievement but it will nonetheless spur us to appreciate your monumental contributions towards this nation. We are a small but great island nation precisely because you and your colleagues have put the nation before yourselves. For that we are utterly grateful.

A million thank you to Mr. Lee Kuan Yew for all that you have done for Singapore! May you rest in peace and may your legacy be forever etched in the history books as one of the greatest leaders of our modern era.
Mohamad Rizal

I cannot fully express the thoughts that are on my mind and the emotions in my heart. But I know that while you do not personally know me, I have personally benefited from your beliefs for our nation. To say that you have done “”so much”” is to limit your contributions. What you’ve put in is immeasurable. Your values and beliefs will live in us, and in our generations to come. I was a student who grew up in this educational system. I am now an educator, and I will certainly inculcate the family values that you have imbued in us as a people. I am proud to be Singaporean, not just for this season, but for as long as I live. We have come a long way, but I am confident that we will go further together. Four words constantly concur this period of time – “”Thank you, Mr Lee””.


The saplings will grow and flourish, just as you wished (and knew) they would.
Khong You Wei

Dear Mr Lee,
These are my heartfelt words:


As part of the younger generation in Singapore, I am fortunate enough to be born into a Singapore that is already flourishing. We live comfortably with a roof above our heads. We receive fresh running water at the turn of the tap. We are able to receive world class education regardless of race or religion. We are able to dream, and to create a future that we own.

Little do we know that sometimes, we do have a tendency to take things for granted. To speak for myself, it is easy to forget how far we have come. These past few days, it had finally dawned upon me that what I am enjoying right now does not come easy. It came at a price and that price is bore by a man who cared – Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

Mr Lee, it is because you care that you dedicated your entire life to building Singapore. It is because you care that you implemented some unpopular, but necessary, policies. You had our best interests at heart. And it is because you care that even though you were criticised by many, you continue to trudge on.

Your love for the nation extends far beyond what the public is able to see. It is because you care that even till the very last day before you were hospitalised that you still continued working with the contents in the “”red box””, trying to better the country we are all living in. It was perhaps because you knew that you do not have much time left that you want to spend the remaining of your time doing all that you can for Singapore.

No monument or statue can ever represent the legacy you have left us with. Just look around and what we see around us is a testament of what you have achieved. Even though you may not be physically here with us, you will continue to live in our hearts. Your work has not ended but has only just begun. It is now in the hands of the new generation of Singaporeans to continue doing what Mr Lee has started. It is now in my hands to build Singapore into what you have envisioned it to be.The journey ahead may not be smooth-sailing but so long as Singaporeans unite together, it is a future we can achieve.

Lastly, from deep within my heart, I just want to thank you once again for caring. Unconditionally.

Remembering you always,
Moo Lee Yin

Dear Founding Father of our Nation, Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
Thank You for creating the Singapore Story for us, and for instilling this sense of pride in each of us as we live on in your legacies that you’ve built your entire life. Without you, there will not be such a prosperous, beautiful and safe Singapore for us today. You’ve struggled and fought hard for us with your lifelong dedication and strong beliefs. May you find peace in heaven with Mrs Lee and to bless us from above.. In your true spirit of perseverance and dedication, we strive to continue to build on your legacy and to develop a promising and stronger Singapore for the many generations to come..
Rest in peace..Thank You Mr Lee!
Shirlyn T.

Dear Mr Lee,
I was moved when I watched the video about the Bukit Ho Swee fire. With 2200 attap huts destroyed and 16000 people homeless overnight, you promised that you would build them new houses in 1 year. And the flats came up in 9 months. I am realising more now why the ruling party is called People’s Action Party. It was a Party taking Action for the People, so that our lives can improve. Your leadership was shown not by what you said, but what you did. You are a God-sent to Singapore. And how I thank God for you. Losing you is like losing a grandfather who has been taking care of us. I hope I will see you again in heaven. What a joy that would be.
Edmund Wong

Lest We Forget


That the times when we had donned our nation’s colours, draped in the red and white of our flag marching proudly into the arena or of the times when we had stood on the podium of champions, victorious, proud and heads turned upwards towards our rising flag as the strains of our anthem echo throughout the stadium or of the times we clasp our clenched fist to our hearts in recitation of our immortal pledge, all these done in lands both near and far, countries large and small.

But done with the indomitable spirit of the athlete who bears the flag of his nation, his people and his country and all these things that are good and true of heart made attainable only by the convictions of the one man who had the foresight, the courage and the very tenacity to forge a people into a nation proud and strong. Our heartfelt tribute to Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, the Father of our nation and a true giant amongst men.
Mervyn Tan, Secretary-General, Federation of Amateur Muaythai of Asia

When Mr Lee was actively fighting for Singapore back in the difficult 60’s I was a young child then, only concern about schoolwork and playtime.
When I became an adult and start working, I was too busy with social commitment and career opportunity so doesn’t pay much attention to what he have been doing for Singapore.
Then Singapore became a first class country and I was a little more aware of our great leader and his hard work. I feel secured having him around, trusting in his every policies for Singapore and have great respect for him but he remain in the background. I do not make much effort to go in depth about his life or work.
Today sadly it take the passing of this great man to suddenly make me realise I have taken for granted what he have done all these years for Singapore. The various media and TV coverage of his life and works these few days was an eye opener. Singapore was his life, his constant worry till the very end. He have done a lot a lot more than most of us ever realise!
Glimpse of his private life and His love for his wife was so touching it make me cry.
Singapore is really very blessed to have such a great leader who have given his whole life to bring the country where it is today. I am honoured to be a Singaporean and to be part of the Singapore legacy which Mr Lee have created.


A big THANK YOU to our most respected Leader for everything u have done for us.
You will be missed greatly.

May You Rest In Peace.

I was born in the early 60’s.It was a time of hard ship and I remember those days that my parents and siblings need to carry pair to contain the water due to water rationing.As the days past and with your far sighted vision and a team of good leaders, look at what we get today. Water easily available as we turn on the tap. Remember those days that we need to walk to school due to poor transportation infrastructure, Now the MRT and buses are right at the door step waiting for us to board.


I would like thank you for sacrificing all whole life for the nation to help to build a first class country right from Zero to who we are today. A Nation that is admired by most of our neighbors.With you and your dedicated team “”PAP””, children of Singapore would not be who we are today. We owe our success, our achievement and our love to you.

You will always be remember by everyone of us forever, your teaching, guidance and love for the country will always live with us. It is time for you to relax and let the people of Singapore to continue your journey that you have plan and build the path for us. May you rest in peace and Bless your son Lee Hsien Loong, our prime minister with good health and good leadership to bring the country to the next Pinnacles.

May God Bless the Singapore Nation with another prosperous SG100.

They say you never know what you have until you lose it. On Monday, Singapore lost a remarkable man with enough dedication, great foresight and love to build a nation.


Over the past few days, I’ve learned about a man who shed tears for a nation. A man who’d do everything in his power to do what’s best for our country. A man who spent more than half his life thinking about how to make Singapore a better place for all of us.

In the recent years, many of us have questioned – or even mocked – the capabilities of our government. Yet, like how a parent has unconditional love towards his children, Mr Lee never once gave up on us. Learning about Mr Lee’s red box made me realise how often Singapore has been on Mr Lee’s mind, how he never stopped dedicating himself to creating a better place for all of us Singaporeans, to creating a better Singapore.

Stories of Mr Lee’s love for Mrs Lee floated throughout the net upon Mr Lee’s passing, but perhaps there is one other love story we may have forgotten. The love story between Mr Lee and all of us Singaporeans.

If someone were to ask me about Mr Lee Kuan Yew, I would tell them he was a remarkable man who had a lot of love to spare. Mr Lee was a man who loved his people enough to know what we needed. A man who loved his country so much that we were always on his mind – even after a surgery, or when he was grieving. He was a man who loved us enough that he never stopped caring even at a ripe age of 91.

And he is a man who will always have my respect and my love.

Thank you, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, for making Singapore what it is today, and for dedicating your life to creating a world class city we can all be proud of. You will always live in our hearts, and may you rest in peace.

My condolences to Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s family.
Love,
Pamela Lim

Dear Mr Lee,
The past week has made me feel that I have never been as proud to be a Singaporean. The unity demonstrated by Singaporeans from all walks of life in the outpouring of our grief, the graciousness, civility and countless acts of kindness witnessed as I queued to pay my last respects to you, the sharing of tributes from prominent individuals all around the world, how highly regarded Singapore is on the world map, far beyond her size.


Although I have never had the honour to meet or encounter you in person, I find myself shedding tears upon knowing of your passing, and occasionally as I watched videos after videos of your historical speeches, of your contributions to building our young nation as well as of numerous individuals speaking fondly of their friendships and encounters with you. You have evidently touched the lives of us all, and no words can express our gratitude towards what you have done to build and nurture Singapore to be that safe, beautiful and prosperous city we call home.

Even as I was studying and living in Australia, my heart never left Singapore and I knew that I would always come back eventually.. Many people belonging in my generation think otherwise. Too many things are taken for granted, we all want more and more for less. I believe, however, that this is a time that we all learn to count our blessings, take a leaf (or two) out of Mr Lee’s book(s) and really give a thought as to what we can do for our country, regardless of how insignificant it may seem.

I wish that you can see the love your people have for you from the heavens above, and may we also be able to do you proud by continuing your legacy and do our part to love our nation home like you had, and to let her flourish for many generations to come.

I am so moved by our founding father Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s abiding passion for Singapore’s future and living out his vision for Singapore. His visionary leadership, strong resilience and his courage to stand for what he believed in, had penned Singapore’s success story today.


Without a remarkable leader like Mr Lee Kuan Yew, we will not have SG50 and without him, we will not be a nation as one united people. We revere him for his notable contributions in putting Singapore on the world map and we salute him for his
spirit of excellence in all he had committed to do for his people.

I am a proud Singaporean because of what he had done to transform a small island state into today’s metropolis. I am also thankful that he had put in place a good and competent leadership team to govern our country.

Thank you Mr Lee Kuan Yew, for your extraordinary leadership and never wanting Singapore to be only second best. Your legacy will inspire us to continue forward. We will fly our Singapore flag high. Abigail Han

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
I stand united with my fellow Singaporeans in mourning your passing. Your vision and leadership has provided me and my family the beautiful and peaceful environment where we can grow and thrive.


The only way my family can repay you is to bear your lessons in our hearts. Hard work, dilligence and respect for other religions and races. Most importantly, we will teach our children to love Singapore, to protect your legacy and hopefully do our little part to make it a better place for all.

May you rest in peace. We will miss you.

I am a native born Singaporean who is just a little bit older than Singapore. I lived through the years of Nation-building – the campaigns, endured National Service, struggled with the Bilingual policy, tolerated the ridicule outsiders heaped on the way we did things.


Growing up, I remember Singaporeans feeling insecure and threatened – by antagonistic neighbours, the threat of economic collapse, our lack of natural resources, the spread of communism (Domino Theory).

Through all that, we had a leader who inspired us to believe in ourselves as a Nation. Fifty years later, we can hold our heads up high. Singapore’s success is Mr LEE KUAN YEW’s success. It is the success of every native Singaporean. Country and leader as one united people.

Nothing can ever change that.

ஒரு புள்ளியை பெரும்புள்ளியாகினாய்
You made a small dot into what is now an icon
கண்ணீர் வேண்டாம் வியர்வை தாவேன்றாய்
You told us not to weep and asked instead for our sweat to build the nation
துயரம் வேண்டாம் உயரம் செல்வோமேன்றாய்
You assured us that we will soar great heights and that sorrow was unnecessary


விடியாத இரவொன்றில் இளம்பிறை வைத்தாய்
In a dusk that felt devoid of dawn you have us the crescent
அதற்க்கு பக்கபலமாக உன் கூற்றை வைத்தாய்
You laid your visions to empower us
தரிசல் பூமியை பூங்கா நகரம் செய்தாய்
What should have been shambles is now the world renowned Garden City

மூத்திர நாற்றம் துரத்தி சுதந்திர வாசம் தந்தாய்
The urine stench was replaced with the breath of independence
பல்லின கூட்டம் இணைத்து ஒருமுகமாக்கினாய்
You unified various races behind one face,as a nation
தமிழுக்கு நீ சங்கம் வைக்கவில்லை,அங்கம் வைத்தாய்
You have Tamil an importance as a National language in our country

மதியாதார் நீர் வாங்க வேண்டாமென புதுநீராக்கினாய்
To not depend on other nations for our water,New Water was implemented
அடுக்குமாடி வீடுகள் மட்டுமா தந்தாய்?
Not only did you make our houses rise (high rise living)
அடுக்கடுக்காக வெற்றிவாகைகளை வாங்கி தந்தாய்!
You have us successive sucesses

பாட்டன்களின் கண்ணீர் துடைத்து தோள்சேர்ந்த தோழன்
The friend whom rubbed shoulders and wiped the tears of our grandfathers
தந்தைகளின் இருள் போக்கி வழிகாட்டிய அறிவுச்சுடர்
The light of knowledge that guided our fathers to success
பெண்களை பாதுகாத்து கௌரவித்த முற்போக்குவாதி
The liberal visionary that protected and dignified the nation’s women

வாய்ச்சொல் வீரம் மட்டுமின்றி செயலில் தீரம் காட்டினாய்
You ensured that your words were translated into efficient action
நீதியை பின்பற்றி வெள்ளையையும் இன்னும் வேன்மையாக்கினாய்
In the unfailing path of justice,white was further whitened (pure and uncorrupted)
குடிமக்களுக்கு பாதுகாப்பளிக்க சட்டத்தை இன்னும் கடுமையாக்கினாய்
Strict laws were enforced for the safety of all

நிர்கதியான நிலையில் நம்மை கைவிடாத முதன் மந்திரி
Even in a state of despair,the 1st Prime Minister that never gave up on us
நாட்டை வாழ்நாளெல்லாம் அரசமைத்த ராஜதந்திரி
The political genius that governed us for all of his life
எங்கள் ராஜ்ஜியத்தின் முடிசூடா மன்னர்,அரசியல் சாணக்யன்
The true king of Singapore with his genius comparable to historically acclaimed political guru Chanakya

இனி எந்த இருட்டு வந்தாலும் நம் மின்சாரம் விளகேற்றும்
Our “”lights””(electricity) is now ready to chase away any darkness
வேறு எந்த துயர் வந்தாலும் நாம் நாடு கைகொடுக்கும்
Our country will lend its hands to help and welcome anyone in need of aid
வறுமையும்,பிணியும்,பசியும் இனி யாரையும் தீண்டா வண்ணம் செய்தாய்
You made sure that poverty,illness and hunger never touched any of us again

மங்கியதோர் நிலவினிலே ஆலம்,மண் சாய்ந்தது
In a blurry mooned night,the mighty Banyan tree fell
நீ ஏற்றிவிட்ட கொடியும் துயர் கனத்து பாதியில் பறக்கின்றது
The flag you raised is flying half mast,heavy with grief
எங்கள் மேர்லாயனுடன்(Merlion) நாங்களும் கண்ணீர் வடிக்கிறோம்!
The nation is mourning in unison as even our Merlion weeps!

சிங்கத்தின் கைபிடித்து நடந்ததால் இது சிங்கபூரானது
We became Singapore because we we led by this Lion (Singa)
அதனால் உலகமே உன் பேர் பாடுது,என்றும் கொண்டாடுது…
The whole world sings your praises and will eternally celebrate you
திரு லீ,இதுவே உங்களுக்கு எங்களின் மனமார்ந்த அஞ்ச-லீ!
Mr Lee,this is the truest tribute (Anjali) we can give you sir!

Dear Mr Lee,
Thank you for your hard work and the sacrifices you had done for Singapore and for the citizens in Singapore.
Thank you for building up the City into what it is now when 50 years ago it was just a small fishing port with no resources – completely nothing.
Thank you for being so far-sighted, knowing that Singapore would be able to make a living with manpower and by improving, we actually became a vibrant financial center from being only focused in industry.
A thousand and million thank yous will not be enough for what you’ve done for Singapore and for us – the future generations.


I have always loved listening to Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s speeches as he really is a charismatic speaker.
There will never be another Mr Lee Kuan Yew in our lives that made such great impact and influence to Singapore and also to the world. The best way to repay him is not only to continue his legacy but also improve Singapore through generations and generations until forever
Oh Jun Min

Dear Mr. Lee,
Thank you for leading Singapore through a tumultuous time, shortly after we gained independence. It was a make-or-break moment, and it is very fortunate for Singapore that we were able to have you, a great visionary, as our first Prime Minister at that time.


From you, I have learnt the importance of foresight; to dare to believe in a dream beyond the times now and realise the concrete steps to reach that dream. I have learnt the importance of being comprehensive in your approach towards a situation; being able to consider the multiple aspects of governance, and the intricate relationship between them. It is rare that such prescience and pragmatism are both present in a person; but you were the right person there, at the right time in the right place.

May you rest in peace.
Sorata

Dear Mr Lee,
You spent your entire life building a democratic society for all Singaporean and our future generations. The guiding principle of meritocracy is entrenched in our society namely education, public housing and healthcare. Regardless of race, language or religion, every Singaporean enjoys the same level playing field to succeed in life. We are reaping the rewards of your wisdom, vision and sheer grit when you decided to stand up for this nation 50yrs ago. No words can describe my heartfelt appreciation to your dedication for Singapore. A huge thanks for everything you have done and sacrifices made along the journey. You gave us not only a nation, but a place we truly call HOME.


Rest in peace, Sir.

With gratitude from a Singapore son

What we have seen over the last few days has been unprecedented. People from all walks of lives bearing the enormous heat, businesses offering in monetary terms in one way or the other including dignitaries abroad have taken time out to pay their respects in every touching manner that they could. The social media has not been spared either. It has been 4 days since your departure and my facebook is flooded with countless eulogies and tributes to yourself. Countless korean colleagues have walked up to me with condolences. Even in the busy central area of downtown Seoul, an area has been setup to pay tribute to your unending convictions you had for our country and your wisdom which was cherished and widely sought after by so many leaders around the world only to wish that they had another great leader just like your goodself in their country.


You probably never would have expected all this happening since your departure. The outpouring of grief has surprised each and everyone of us. Each person who is standing in the queue as we speak has so much to gratitude and words for you, for you have touched our lifes in one way or another. At certain times during your tenure, the nation may not have understood some of your decisions. Some of them may have been decided easily, but we know that most of it has been difficult. But now, i strongly believe that no matter how easy or difficult those decisions are, you only had 1 clear objective. That is to provide the lives of those living in this nation, the ability to stand proud and be as self-sufficient as much as we could.

Even in your departure, you have the power to bring the people of this nation together despite all the differences. The legacy you have left behind will bind us all together in many years to come.

On sunday, the people of this nation togther with world leaders, will all rise to give you a long standing ovation, one that will probably never be experienced in many years to come.

This will all go down on the history books and is yours and ours to keep forever, in our heavy hearts and minds. Given time, we will definitely heal, but will and can never forget.

Thereafter, we will continue to live proudly, the Singapore dream that you have bestowed upon us.

I am a History teacher at Zhonghua Secondary School. It was an odd chance of coincidence that on the day of Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s passing, the topic we were covering in class was Separation from Merger. Having taught this topic a number of times, I had shown many students the famous ‘Moment of Anguish’ video clip. On 23rd of March however, the lesson was markedly different. It took on sentimental value to my students and myself as we realised that we were looking back at a historically momentous event for Singapore on an equally momentous day marking the passing away of a great Forefather of our Nation. The disappointment and anguish felt by the late Mr Lee at that press conference was better appreciated and understood by us now that the full extent of his sacrifice for the Nation is made public. Students are also a lot more curious to want to find out more in light of the public sentiment pouring in for him.


As an educator, I must say teaching this topic subsequently will never be the same. References to the amazing displays of public gratitude for his 50 years of sacrifice will definitely be included in my future lessons to pay homage to the vision and passion this great man had for making his nation succeed.

With my upper secondary classes, the current situation presented authentic teaching moments as well and gave me pleasant insights about the younger generation. Imagining that some may believe the reverence for Mr Lee as being excessive, I had requested the opinions of students including that of ASEAN scholars who came from countries with prestigious founding Fathers like Ho Chih Minh. Majority of students interestingly felt the public sentiment to be a long overdue show of gratitude for the blessings of living in our nation and rather befitting the personal sacrifices made by a man for the greater good. The sharing by their Vietnamese peers had also made them appreciate the fact that we also have our own National Hero whose work and memory will continue to rally the nation together. It was heartening for me as an educator to realise that the younger generation do not lack for empathy and will give honour where honour is due.

In the end, these are our most cherished memories of Mr Lee Kuan Yew: He was unapologetically singleminded and decisive in doing whatever necessary to make Singapore better. He insisted meritocracy to be the cornerstone of our society. Even leaders of countries more powerful in the international arena affirmed his vision and common sense. Despite being such a successful public figure, he obviously was a private success affirmed by the quality of his marriage and children.

Thank you Mr Lee! As a History Teacher in the Singapore education system, it will be my privellege to keep you and your work remembered with my future students. You are truly a national hero and History teaches us very well the power of heroes in forging national identity and pride. Even in death, you make History:) RIP and I pray Singapore will continue to renew itself with new wave of leaders who display similar passion and vision.

The sadness is overwhelming, the heaviness, palpable. The day we knew would come, had arrived. Reality hits home like a ton of bricks.


Mr Lee is my hero. Having travelled extensively throughout the region and seeing the lives there, I’m truly grateful for Singapore. Each time I travel, I’m always glad to return home. From now on, apart from being glad, I will say, ‘Thank you, Mr Lee’.

I’ve read his books and heard many accounts of Mr Lee. I admired him greatly and thought I knew him. How ignorant. Now, reading the myriad of articles and personal experiences of people who have had the wonderful opportunity to know him personally, I know what I didn’t know. The impact of his presence in the lives of so many brings to light what a giant of a man Mr Lee truly is.

He epitomizes dignity, honour, resilience, commitment, devotion and many more qualities that every person should aspire to live up to. How is it possible that a man has within him so much strength and determination and generosity to give everything for his country? There’s no answer except one — he is Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

Standing in line for more than 3 hours under the sweltering hot sun in Padang, another thought arrests my heart. I am truly so proud of my country. There were crowds thronging, sweating, cramped but everyone, patient. When the line finally started moving again, we all cheered. Partly because we were glad to stretch our aching legs but largely, we were nearer to seeing our hero. Our nation rallied for the man we love and respect. For that man who gave us all, this week, Singaporeans did their best to demonstrate the qualities Mr Lee so naturally possessed. To witness volunteers handing out umbrellas, cakes, bottles of water to the crowd, to witness kindness, consideration, I am so so proud of my fellow citizens, my country and being a Singaporean. Never again will I take my red passport for granted.

Mr Lee, you are my hero. My children will not see you in action for themselves. But Mr Lee, I promise you, I will do my best to bring up my children to be honorable, resilient, committed, and tenacious like you. To tell them stories about you. To be men who dream big, to know what matters, to follow a worthy cause, pursue it with integrity, grit and courage, to never give up. And because of what you have done for us, they have the perfect environment to grow up and do all that.

Thank you, Mr Lee. You are forever in our hearts.
Veron Khoh

Dear Mr. Lee,
What was a week of mourning turned out to also be a week of reflection, an opportunity for myself to look back at how much Singapore has progressed since those early days in 1965.


Suffice to say, we would never have made it without your vision and your drive. I would like to thank you not only for your leadership but also for your dedication and the personal responsibility you undertook to secure our future – the future of all Singaporeans.

Today, all of Singapore bids you our final farewell. I will miss your strength and your wisdom, and I will always remember all that you have taught us.

To borrow a line from Marcus Aurelius, Roman Emperor and philosopher: “”What we do now echoes in eternity.”” Your legacy will certainly echo in the lives of Singaporeans for many generations to come.

Rest well, Mr. Lee. Thank you for giving your life for Singapore.
Wong Chee Leong
