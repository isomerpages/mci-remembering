## View 2015 Tributes from Foreign Leaders

#### ASEAN Secretary-General, Le Luong Minh
ASEAN Secretary-General Le Luong Minh joined other world leaders in mourning the loss of Lee Kuan Yew, the first Prime Minister of Singapore, who passed away yesterday at 91. In a letter addressed to Lee Hsien Loong, Prime Minister of Singapore and son of Lee Kuan Yew, Secretary-General Minh conveyed his “deepest condolences” on the passing of the late Prime Minister.

In his letter, Minh described Lee Kuan Yew as “a great statesman who had built Singapore with his vision, wisdom and courage.” The ASEAN Secretary-General also acknowledged the late Prime Minister as one of those “instrumental in the establishment of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations” in 1967. Singapore is one of ASEAN’s five founding members and together with the other leaders, he has provided guidance to ASEAN in its formative years.
For three decades, Lee Kuan Yew dedicated his life to the success of his country and is widely recognised as the architect of Singapore’s transformation from a small port town 50 years ago to one of the world’s wealthiest countries. Secretary-General Minh noted that the late Prime Minister “has left a lasting legacy not only for Singapore but also for ASEAN and he will be greatly missed.”

“Every time I came for a meeting with the Singapore Army, he would definitely invite me for talks. I was shocked the first time. I was only the Army Chief. He was more senior than the prime minister. But he wanted to speak to me – not once but five times,” said General (Retired) Ryamizard.

“I regard him as a true statesman. He did not discriminate against anyone. He spoke from the heart and I responded likewise. He was sincere in his views. And I responded with sincerity. We understood each other,” he added.

General (Retired) Ryamizard likened his discussions with Mr Lee to those between a father and son. He said Mr Lee’s honesty and sincerity laid the foundation for good ties between Indonesia and Singapore’s armed forces.

“We must talk to each other, whatever the issues may be. There’s nothing hidden, because we know he is sincere, forthright. The rest of us followed the same,” said General (Retired) Ryamizard.

“From earlier on, Indonesia and Singapore conducted joint military exercises annually. The two armies took turns to host. Similarly, for the air force and navy. It has been going on well. That’s a result of the foundations laid from the top. That’s how it was between Mr Lee and President Suharto,” he added.

Mr Lee Kuan Yew was ‘an extraordinary human being': George Shultz
SINGAPORE: Former US Secretary of State George Shultz expressed his condolences at Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s passing. In a letter addressed to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Monday (Mar 23), he said: “I grieve, as do so many all over the world, at the passing of your father and my friend of a half century… Lee Kuan Yew.”

Saying that Mr Lee was “an extraordinary human being”, Mr Shultz added that he had always considered Mr Lee one of the wisest and most intelligent people he had ever known.

Mr Lee's Red Box
By Minister Heng Swee Keat, former Principal Private Secretary to Mr Lee

![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/stories-from-media/red%20box-1024x682.jpg)

Mr Lee Kuan Yew had a red box. When I worked as Mr Lee’s Principal Private Secretary, or PPS, a good part of my daily life revolved around the red box. Before Mr Lee came in to work each day, the locked red box would arrive first, at about 9 am.
As far as the various officers who have worked with Mr Lee can remember, he had it for many, many years. It is a large, boxy briefcase, about fourteen centimetres wide. Red boxes came from the British government, whose Ministers used them for transporting documents between government offices. Our early Ministers had red boxes, but Mr Lee is the only one I know who used his consistently through the years. When I started working for Mr Lee in 1997, it was the first time I saw a red box in use. It is called the red box but is more a deep wine colour, like the seats in the chamber in Parliament House.
This red box held what Mr Lee was working on at any one time. Through the years, it held his papers, speech drafts, letters, readings, and a whole range of questions, reflections, and observations. For example, in the years that Mr Lee was working on his memoirs, the red box carried the multiple early drafts back and forth between his home and the office, scribbled over with his and Mrs Lee’s notes.
For a long time, other regular items in Mr Lee’s red box were the cassette tapes that held his dictated instructions and thoughts for later transcription. Some years back, he changed to using a digital recorder.
The red box carried a wide range of items. It could be communications with foreign leaders, observations about the financial crisis, instructions for the Istana grounds staff, or even questions about some trees he had seen on the expressway. Mr Lee was well-known for keeping extremely alert to everything he saw and heard around him – when he noticed something wrong, like an ailing raintree, a note in the red box would follow.
We could never anticipate what Mr Lee would raise – it could be anything that was happening in Singapore or the world. But we could be sure of this: it would always be about how events could affect Singapore and Singaporeans, and how we had to stay a step ahead. Inside the red box was always something about how we could create a better life for all.
We would get to work right away. Mr Lee’s secretaries would transcribe his dictated notes, while I followed up on instructions that required coordination across multiple government agencies. Our aim was to do as much as we could by the time Mr Lee came into the office later.
While we did this, Mr Lee would be working from home. For example, during the time that I worked with him (1997-2000), the Asian Financial Crisis ravaged many economies in our region and unleashed political changes. It was a tense period as no one could tell how events would unfold. Often, I would get a call from him to check certain facts or arrange meetings with financial experts.
In the years that I worked for him, Mr Lee’s daily breakfast was a bowl of dou hua (soft bean curd), with no syrup. It was picked up and brought home in a tiffin carrier every morning, from a food centre near Mr Lee’s home. He washed it down with room-temperature water. Mr Lee did not take coffee or tea at breakfast.
When Mr Lee came into the office, the work that had come earlier in the red box would be ready for his review, and he would have a further set of instructions for our action.
From that point on, the work day would run its normal course. Mr Lee read the documents and papers, cleared his emails, and received official calls by visitors. I was privileged to sit in for every meeting he conducted. He would later ask me what I thought of the meetings – it made me very attentive to every word that was said, and I learnt much from Mr Lee.
Evening was Mr Lee’s exercise time. Mr Lee has described his extensive and disciplined exercise regime elsewhere. It included the treadmill, rowing, swimming and walking – with his ears peeled to the evening news or his Mandarin practice tapes. He would sometimes take phone calls while exercising.
He was in his 70s then. In more recent years, being less stable on his feet, Mr Lee had a simpler exercise regime. But he continued to exercise. Since retiring from the Minister Mentor position in 2011, Mr Lee was more relaxed during his exercises. Instead of listening intently to the news or taking phone calls, he shared his personal stories and joked with his staff.
While Mr Lee exercised, those of us in the office would use that time to focus once again on the red box, to get ready all the day’s work for Mr Lee to take home with him in the evening. Based on the day’s events and instructions, I tried to get ready the materials that Mr Lee might need. It sometimes took longer than I expected, and occasionally, I had to ask the security officer to come back for the red box later.
While Mrs Lee was still alive, she used to drop by the Istana at the end of the day, in order to catch a few minutes together with Mr Lee, just to sit and look at the Istana trees that they both loved. They chatted about what many other old couples would talk about. They discussed what they should have for dinner, or how their grandchildren were doing.
Then back home went Mr Lee, Mrs Lee and the red box. After dinner, Mr and Mrs Lee liked to take a long stroll. In his days as Prime Minister, while Mrs Lee strolled, Mr Lee liked to ride a bicycle. It was, in the words of those who saw it, “one of those old man bicycles”. None of us who have worked at the Istana can remember him ever changing his bicycle. He did not use it in his later years, as he became frail, but I believe the “old man bicycle” is still around somewhere.
After his dinner and evening stroll, Mr Lee would get back to his work. That was when he opened the red box and worked his way through what we had put into it in the office.
Mr Lee’s study is converted out of his son’s old bedroom. His work table is a simple, old wooden table with a piece of clear glass placed over it. Slipped under the glass are family memorabilia, including a picture of our current PM from his National Service days. When Mrs Lee was around, she stayed up reading while Mr Lee worked. They liked to put on classical music while they stayed up.
In his days as PM, Mr Lee’s average bedtime was three-thirty in the morning. As Senior Minister and Minister Mentor, he went to sleep after two in the morning. If he had to travel for an official visit the next day, he might go to bed at one or two in the morning.
Deep into the night, while the rest of Singapore slept, it was common for Mr Lee to be in full work mode.
Before he went to bed, Mr Lee would put everything he had completed back in the red box, with clear pointers on what he wished for us to do in the office. The last thing he did each day was to place the red box outside his study room. The next morning, the duty security team picked up the red box, brought it to us waiting in the office, and a new day would begin.
Let me share two other stories involving the red box.
In 1996, Mr Lee underwent balloon angioplasty to insert a stent. It was his second heart operation in two months, after an earlier operation to widen a coronary artery did not work. After the operation, he was put in the Intensive Care Unit for observation. When he regained consciousness and could sit up in bed, he asked for his security team. The security officer hurried into the room to find out what was needed. Mr Lee asked, “Can you pass me the red box?”
Even at that point, Mr Lee’s first thought was to continue working. The security officer rushed the red box in, and Mr Lee asked to be left to his work. The nurses told the security team that other patients of his age, in Mr Lee’s condition, would just rest. Mr Lee was 72 at the time.
In 2010, Mr Lee was hospitalised again, this time for a chest infection. While he was in the hospital, Mrs Lee passed away. Mr Lee has spoken about his grief at Mrs Lee’s passing. As soon as he could, he left the hospital to attend the wake at Sri Temasek.
At the end of the night, he was under doctor’s orders to return to the hospital. But he asked his security team if they could take him to the Singapore River instead. It was late in the night, and Mr Lee was in mourning. His security team hastened to give a bereaved husband a quiet moment to himself.
As Mr Lee walked slowly along the bank of the Singapore River, the way he and Mrs Lee sometimes did when she was still alive, he paused. He beckoned a security officer over. Then he pointed out some trash floating on the river, and asked, “Can you take a photo of that? I’ll tell my PPS what to do about it tomorrow.” Photo taken, he returned to the hospital.
I was no longer Mr Lee’s PPS at the time. I had moved on to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, to continue with the work to strengthen our financial regulatory system that Mr Lee had started in the late 1990s. But I can guess that Mr Lee probably had some feedback on keeping the Singapore River clean. I can also guess that the picture and the instructions were ferried in Mr Lee’s red box the next morning to the office. Even as Mr Lee lay in the hospital. Even as Mrs Lee lay in state.
The security officers with Mr Lee were deeply touched. When I heard about these moments, I was also moved.
I have taken some time to describe Mr Lee’s red box. The reason is that, for me, it symbolises Mr Lee’s unwavering dedication to Singapore so well. The diverse contents it held tell us much about the breadth of Mr Lee’s concerns – from the very big to the very small; the daily routine of the red box tells us how Mr Lee’s life revolved around making Singapore better, in ways big and small.
By the time I served Mr Lee, he was the Senior Minister. Yet he continued to devote all his time to thinking about the future of Singapore. I could only imagine what he was like as Prime Minister. In policy and strategy terms, he was always driving himself, me, and all our colleagues to think about what each trend and development meant for Singapore, and how we should respond to it in order to secure Singapore’s wellbeing and success.
As his PPS, I saw the punishing pace of work that Mr Lee set himself. I had a boss whose every thought and every action was for Singapore.
But it takes private moments like these to bring home just how entirely Mr Lee devoted his life to Singapore.
In fact, I think the best description comes from the security officer who was with Mr Lee both of those times. He was on Mr Lee’s team for almost 30 years. He said of Mr Lee: “Mr Lee is always country, country, country. And country.”
This year, Singapore turns 50. Mr Lee would have turned 92 this September. Mr Lee entered the hospital on 5 February 2015. He continued to use his red box every day until 4 February 2015.

#### Obituary from Fitzwilliam College University of Cambridge
Lee Kuan Yew, who died on 23 March 2015, was the most significant statesman to be a member of Fitzwilliam College. He was Prime Minister of Singapore for the first three decades of its independence, and led its transformation to a flourishing first-world nation.

Lee Kuan Yew was born in 1923 and was educated at Raffles Institution, where in 1940 he came first amongst all pupils in Singapore and Malaya and won a scholarship to Raffles College. His university education was ended by the Japanese invasion in 1941; he was at considerable personal risk, as many young Chinese men were massacred.

After the war, Lee determined to go to England and read Law. At the London School of Economics, he was overwhelmed by living in London and sought a more congenial environment in Cambridge. One of his fellow Raffles College students introduced him to W S Thatcher, the Censor of Fitzwilliam House, who admitted him for the 1947 Lent term. This proved to be an inspired decision: despite all the disruption to his education, Lee’s high ability and determination ensured that he graduated First Class in both parts of the Tripos; his Starred First for Part II Law in 1949 placed him at the very top of his cohort, above two contemporaries who became Professors of Law in Cambridge, and gained for him Fitzwilliam’s Whitlock Prize. He was called to the Bar at the Middle Temple in 1950.

Politics was central to his life. Back in Singapore, as a barrister he represented many cases of actual or alleged rebellious behaviour against the colonial government. The Malayan Communist Party was fomenting trouble, but Lee established the non-Communist People’s Action Party in 1954 and became the first Prime Minister in 1959, when Britain ceded all internal responsibilities to Singapore.

At that time, Lee Kuan Yew favoured a merger between Singapore and Malaya, and in 1963 the fully-independent Federation of Malaysia was formed, incorporating Singapore, peninsular Malaya, and Sabah and Sarawak in Borneo. This lasted only until 1965, when Singapore left the Federation and became independent; that the union was unviable was a matter of great regret to him.

Under Lee’s leadership as Prime Minister, and with the determination and hard work of its people, Singapore was transformed from a territory with few resources into a nation which now has GDP/head over 50% greater than that of the UK. Lee Kuan Yew retired in 1990, but for several years exerted influence under the title of Minister Mentor. Whilst many in the West were critical of some of his policies, for example on criminal justice and restrictions on freedom of speech, Lee justified these by arguing that in developing a nation so fast, some freedoms had to be sacrificed.

Lee Kuan Yew was elected to an Honorary Fellowship of Fitzwilliam in 1969, and for many years was the most senior of the College’s Honorary Fellows. Two years later, he gave the Foundation Lecture: East and West – the twain have met.

The connection between Fitzwilliam College and Singapore has continued to be strong over several generations. A substantial and significant body of Singaporean leaders in the professions and the nation have studied at Fitzwilliam, including Lee’s younger brothers who read Law and Medicine. Currently, there are 16 Singaporean undergraduates and 12 graduate students in the College.

Acts of kindness: Community spirit continues to run high
Singaporeans have continued to show their generosity and kindness throughout this mourning period for the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

Mr Jasper Tan, YEO’s sales representative, made it a point to involve his children – 8-year-old Seth and 7-year-old Shain-ann – in the distribution of drinks and bottled water to those waiting in line on the third day of the Lying-in-State. Students from the Anglo-Chinese Junior College also did their part in handing out drinks and food at the Padang.

Many other unsung heroes also helped ensure that the place remained clean. A member of public was seen voluntarily picking up litter at the Padang, an endeavour which Youth Corps Singapore’s volunteers also took on. Workers, such as staff from SMRT, technicians and cleaners from Hong Lim Park, also worked tirelessly through the night to help make the wait more comfortable.

Local entrepreneurs are also exercising their creativity and providing members of public with various ways in which they can pay tribute to Mr Lee Kuan Yew.





 

 

The vigil guards is the nation’s highest form of respect given to the deceased. It is made up of uniformed officers from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Police. They will stand  solemnly in formation – four on each corner of the casket, and one senior officer at the head of it facing inwards.

They will stand guard round the clock  as the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew lies in state at the Parliament House,  their heads slightly bowed, making no eye contact with anyone,  their swords inverted.

Every 30 minutes, the four guards near the casket will change shifts. There are 60 vigil guards in total.

We manage to get some of the Vigil guards who are getting ready to relieve their colleagues to share with us their emotional experience.



Companies also took the initiative to create their own tribute sites to honour the late Mr Lee. Below are some pictures from these tribute sites.

They may have not experienced first-hand the trying times of Singapore’s building years. Yet they came to pay tribute to Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

Across the island, young children have been visiting community sites to pen tribute messages for Mr Lee, a man they have only read about in books or heard about from their parents and teachers.

This young girl came with her parents to thank Mr Lee. When she arrived, observers saw her rush to the board and tip-toe to pick up a marker. Without hesitation, she proceeded to draw a circle bigger than her heart and penned a message to Mr Lee.

This is what she said:

“Dear Mr Lee, Thank you for everything I have today, my flat, my education, my famili/s (sic) peaceful times when everywhere in this world people worry about basic necessities. I am the first in my family to be able to complete my education and is the first graduate, to my parents who are near illiterate. Thank you for changing our lives.”

Mr Lee Kuan Yew not only touched the lives of Singaporeans, but also the lives of many who came to work in Singapore. Upon hearing of Mr Lee’s passing, these former workers set up their own tribute site back in Tamil Nadu, India, to pay their respects.

Paying Tribute to One Man in Diverse Ways
The widely-familiar image of a black ribbon framing Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s profile has birthed car decals, badges, T-shirt logos, stickers and more. Created by Member of Parliament Alex Yam and his team, the logo was also printed on 1,000 customised balloons, produced by a group of Singaporeans and Singapore Permanent Residents who were brought together by a common sense of grief and a wish to honour the late Mr Lee. The passing of founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew saw a nation coming together to both honour and mourn, in a myriad of manner and form. It would not be possible to put together an exhaustive list of tributes conceptualised and paid; the following are but some of the highlights.

A Final Send-off: Crowds Line State Funeral Procession Route
The skies opened and heavy rain fell on the crowds lining the State Funeral procession route. However, they were not deterred and stayed put, determined to bid a final farewell to Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Heeding the calls to dress in either black or white, members of public at the Padang armed themselves with umbrellas and ponchos and waited patiently in the downpour for the departure of the gun carriage bearing Mr Lee’s casket from Parliament House. Thousands lined the streets from St Andrews Road to Shenton Way, Cantonment Road to Clementi Road, bearing the Singapore flag in an emotional send-off.

Even as the rain poured, Singaporeans braved the elements, lining the streets to catch a glimpse of the funeral procession and gathering at various Community Tribute Sites with their fellow Singaporeans to witness the State Funeral Service for Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

The mood was sombre as the cortege made its way to the University Cultural Centre, where 10 eulogies were delivered. Many could not hold back their tears as the nation bids its final farewell to the leader who built Singapore.

Tributes continued to flow in even during the final moments.

The week of national mourning saw Singaporeans across all ages and races, and from all walks of life come together to celebrate Mr Lee’s lifetime of achievements, grieve for his passing and relive moments of our history.

In his passing, Mr Lee Kuan Yew once again united the nation as only he can. As Singaporeans joined our voices to recite the pledge and sing the national anthem, it is clear that we are more determined than ever to safeguard the legacy that he has left behind.
