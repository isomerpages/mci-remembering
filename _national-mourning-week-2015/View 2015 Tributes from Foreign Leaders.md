## View 2015 Tributes from Foreign Leaders

#### ASEAN Secretary-General, Le Luong Minh
ASEAN Secretary-General Le Luong Minh joined other world leaders in mourning the loss of Lee Kuan Yew, the first Prime Minister of Singapore, who passed away yesterday at 91. In a letter addressed to Lee Hsien Loong, Prime Minister of Singapore and son of Lee Kuan Yew, Secretary-General Minh conveyed his “deepest condolences” on the passing of the late Prime Minister.

In his letter, Minh described Lee Kuan Yew as “a great statesman who had built Singapore with his vision, wisdom and courage.” The ASEAN Secretary-General also acknowledged the late Prime Minister as one of those “instrumental in the establishment of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations” in 1967. Singapore is one of ASEAN’s five founding members and together with the other leaders, he has provided guidance to ASEAN in its formative years.
For three decades, Lee Kuan Yew dedicated his life to the success of his country and is widely recognised as the architect of Singapore’s transformation from a small port town 50 years ago to one of the world’s wealthiest countries. Secretary-General Minh noted that the late Prime Minister “has left a lasting legacy not only for Singapore but also for ASEAN and he will be greatly missed.”

#### Defence Minister of Indonesia, General (Retired) Ryamizard Ryacudu
“Every time I came for a meeting with the Singapore Army, he would definitely invite me for talks. I was shocked the first time. I was only the Army Chief. He was more senior than the prime minister. But he wanted to speak to me – not once but five times,” said General (Retired) Ryamizard.

“I regard him as a true statesman. He did not discriminate against anyone. He spoke from the heart and I responded likewise. He was sincere in his views. And I responded with sincerity. We understood each other,” he added.

General (Retired) Ryamizard likened his discussions with Mr Lee to those between a father and son. He said Mr Lee’s honesty and sincerity laid the foundation for good ties between Indonesia and Singapore’s armed forces.

“We must talk to each other, whatever the issues may be. There’s nothing hidden, because we know he is sincere, forthright. The rest of us followed the same,” said General (Retired) Ryamizard.

“From earlier on, Indonesia and Singapore conducted joint military exercises annually. The two armies took turns to host. Similarly, for the air force and navy. It has been going on well. That’s a result of the foundations laid from the top. That’s how it was between Mr Lee and President Suharto,” he added.


#### EU Ambassador to Singapore, Dr Michael Pulch
p>I wish to express my heartfelt sympathy to his family and the people of Singapore for the passing away of Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

He was an inspiring statesman whose vision of an independent and prosperous Singapore became the foundation of its lasting success.

Throughout his political life generations of European leaders did seek his views and advice to better understand dynamics in this part of the world. He will be deeply missed.

– Dr Michael Pulch, EU Ambassador to Singapore

#### Former Foreign Minister of Indonesia, Dr Marty Natalegawa
“Mr Lee not only promoted Singapore’s national interests but also kept them in line with that of the region. By backing regional integration, Mr Lee contributed a great deal to the conducive climate of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), where member states engage and work towards their regional goals without interfering with each other”

Saya menganggap Bapak Lee Kuan Yew sebagai sahabat dekat dan saya tahu bahwa beliau adalah sahabat sejati Indonesia.

Setiap pertemuan saya dengan Bapak Lee Kuan Yew selalu memberikan pelajaran berharga bagi saya. Ia adalah sosok yang bijaksana dan wawasannya mengenai hubungan internasional sangat luas.

Semenjak saya menjabat sebagai Presiden Republik Indonesia, saya telah bertemu beberapa kali dengan Bapak Lee Kuan Yew. Di setiap pertemuan tersebut Ia selalu memberikan motivasi dan nasihat yang tak ternilai bagi kemajuan Indonesia.

Bapak Lee Kuan Yew dikenal sebagai salah satu Kepala Negara yang sangat dihormati di Asia.

Sebagai salah satu pendiri ASEAN, Bapak Lee Kuan Yew telah menjadi tokoh penting dalam transformasi Asia Tenggara menuju komunitas dinamis yang damai seperti saat ini.

Bapak Lee Kuan Yew akan selalu dikenang tidak hanya oleh masyarakat Singapura, namun juga masyarakat Indonesia dan Asia Tenggara.

Semoga Almarhum dapat beristirahat dengan tenang.

I would like to thank you for all that you have done for us, Singaporean. Your big vision, wisdom, determination and perseverance bring good life to Singaporean.

This is from one of my favorite authors: “Everyone must leave something behind when he dies, my grandfather said. A child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes made. Or a garden planted. Something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die, and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted, you’re there.


It doesn’t matter what you do, he said, so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something that’s like you after you take your hands away. The difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching, he said. The lawn-cutter might just as well not have been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime.”
― Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451

You’re the gardener, sir. May your legacy live on forever.

Dear Mr Lee,


In your passing, I give thanks to you and your team for laying the foundation of this republic. I like to highlight areas deserving praise.

In education, many have been uplifted out of poverty. Education is key to the thinking man. Without the capacity to read and learn, a man is doomed to ignorance. The key to controlling a population is depriving them of education, but you have done the opposite. You have given the populace the key to free themselves, opening up for many to have good jobs and exploring the world. The critics of today is also a product of this education. Without education, many would never even learn to question.

In housing, the modest HDB flat is testim

As an educator, I will strive impart values to nurture good and useful citizens, to inculate the national identity, to carry on the legacy and to continue to make Singapore a better home. My purpose is clear.

And now, my pride as a Singaporean is instinctive.
I stand with my head held high, I AM SINGAPOREAN.

Thank you, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

Dear Mr Lee,


Thank you for everything you have done for Singapore. You have spent almost your whole life, with unwavering dedication and hard work to build up Singapore to what she is today. Singapore is very fortunate to have you as our 1st PM during the early years.

As more stories of you start to emerge on news & social media, you have gained many more Singaporeans’ respect & admiration, especially from the younger generation who are very fortunate to enjoy the fruits of your labour. We also start to learn more about you, about your frugality & your love for your family & your people. You are even admired & respected overseas.

Mr Lee, you are a good role model for us to follow. You will always be fondly remembered in every Singaporeans’ heart & in future generations to come as a great founding father.
With love & gratitude, Charlotte Neo

Dear Mr Lee,


Thank you for very much for your contribution to building Singapore from a small fishing village into a first world country. Without you, we are not even a dot, but because of your great contribution, we are now a small red dot which shines like a red ruby among a cup of pure crystal.

I live in the time when you are the PM of Singapore. I watch most telecast of your speech. I look forward to your speech each time they were delivered. Although I might not fully understand, I enjoy watching you over TV.

Our day starts with a fresh gush of tap water, which is so clean and conveniently available from home tap. We stay in a safe and secure flat. We open the windows and we see a garden of green, we breathe fresher air.

When it’s time for children to school, public buses are easily available across the overhead bridge. We do not need to walk in mud like those days in kampung.

The children are bilingualists, although I hope they could pick up dialect as well. At this point, they speak English and Mandarin, At least they could interact with the world, for now and in the future.

Without the stability of the country, investors are not going to come in. I previous have a job with a foreign company and at least I have a stable income. I am currently a homemaker as I think that educating children and taking care of them, bring them up well, is as important too.

Thank you very much for all these, I am deeply grateful.

You left. I wet my eyes almost everyday. We no longer can see you LIVE on TV. We lost our precious Great man. No word can express the pain deep in me for losing you, our Singapore Father, Mr Lee KY.

Please take a higher rebirth, Mr Lee.the joy of moving to high-rise flats from these slumps. I have never experienced water rationing or the uncertainty of mass unemployment. Hence I must admit, my feeling of sadness is not at the same level as that of my Father and our Pioneer Generation when the news of Mr. Lee’s passing broke on the wee hours of Monday morning. However, I greatly admire and respect Mr. Lee for his values, passion, single-mindedness, intellect and resolve. As with most Singaporeans, I am grateful to Mr. Lee for dedicating his life to Singapore, without which I am not sure we can enjoy the kind of life that we have right now.
Mr. Lee’s values of hard work, integrity, perseverance, and resilience are even more relevant now in this increasingly uncertain world. Many may not have agreed with his knuckle buster and tough love approach to nation building, but it is something befitting of for that period of time. How Mr. Lee came out of his moment of anguish with greater resolve and then went on to achieve greater things is something I am learning with my own moments of anguish. Mr. Lee’s oratory skills is second to none. His speeches were robust and fiery. I remembered watching all of Mr. Lee’s speeches on the internet whilst preparing for a speech examination for a Business Communications module in university. I even tried to learn his habit of pulling his pants up while trying to make a major point!

On our journey back home from Parliament House, we discussed about the future of Singapore after Mr. Lee. My sister in laws felt uncertain at how Singapore will cope should there be a serious crisis. Will our youths have the toughness, guts and gumption to stand up and be counted? Will Singapore have a soul? I don’t think any of us will have the answer. But I think a good start is to make sure that we never forget the Lee Kuan Yew story and that our youths understand what he stands for and what he had had gone through to make Singapore it is today.

May you rest in peace Mr. Lee Kuan Yew.

“Merdeka! One more time with more feeling… Merdeka!”
Melvin Vu

Dearest Mr Lee,
Thank you, although words alone is not enough to express my gratitude to you. I have chosen to stay away from the historic queuing at the Parliament House area, but tostay home to watch the videos of you from early days to the most recent appearance of you, of what you said, what you did and how you transformed mudflats to metropolis.


I never paid so much attention during history lessons in school. This week, Singapore woke up to the fact that the peace and prosperity that we enjoy, have not come by accident. You are the Godsend gift to my country, my home. If not for you, I wouldn’t be blessed with the opportunities at school, at work and raising my children. I am able to speak fluent and write English and Chinese, only because of you.

I wept a lot this week, just like many others in Singapore. I would miss you. For sure, going forward, as I watch our future leaders perform, I will ponder “”what would LKY have done?””

You physically depart tomorrow. We start a new chapter without LKY. But you will watch over us, right?

Rest in peace, Mr Lee.
Agnes Lim

With a heavy heart, the nation bids farewell to an honourable and highly respected leader, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.


Without his vision and strong willpower in building this nation out of nothing, there wouldn’t be Singapore on the map.

前人种树，后人乘凉
Without him and his team, we wouldn’t have a house to live in, potable water straight from the tap, an established and highly efficient transport network compared abroad, a clean and green city. With his strict law and regulation, we don’t have to worry about food safety or crime in our neighbourhood. Not forgetting his bilingualism policy and high quality education system, we have become competent and adept citizens.

Of course, the wise man had done more than the aforementioned.
Mr Lee’s foresight paved the way for the gleaming success of modern Singapore. Indeed, Singapore is our home truly.

Mr Lee will be deeply missed as we won’t see another man like him.

With deepest gratitude and appreciation to our founding father, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
Pamela

Dear Mr. Lky,


Your contribution to this country and its people are indescribable. You took helm of segregated, poor and dirty mess and took it to where it is today. You are passionate, dedicated and your wisdom and foresight remains unparrelled in the region. Your voice and presence commanded the utmost respect and admiration from people worldwide.

Take a look around us and take a moment to think about this. Would things be the same if it wasn’t for you? Would I even be here if it wasn’t for you? I dare say that the train I am riding on as I pen this wouldn’t be here, the HDB I live in wouldn’t be there and the safe society that even most first world country dream of having wouldn’t exist. Singapore wouldn’t exist.

But these are just the tangible things that you have left behind. Looking beyond this, you have left behind something of unfathomable scale. You have created a sense of national identity, a national spirit, a sense of belonging. Singapore Singaporean, that I am proud of.

What is your life story? Your life is the story of how Sigapore came to be what it is. We are eternally grateful for what you have left behind. Your legacy remains.

May you rest in peace.

Prime minister Lee Hsien Loong, I wish to express my deepest and heartfelt condolences to you and your family.
Yours sincerely,Lew Jun Fei

23rd March 2015 was truly a very sad day for all Singaporeans, as our Nation grieved the loss of our founding Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew. Despite that I have never met Mr. Lee in person; he was undoubtedly a legendary great man who I hold in high regard, and his passing deeply pained me.


For many Singaporeans, he was the very man known to have devoted whole of himself, and his life, building Singapore – a place where we are proud to call ‘Our Home’ today. No amount of words can describe my heartfelt gratitude towards him. He was truly a blessing to Singapore.

Thank you Sir, for shining

Exemplifying the virtues of a good leader, we look towards the continuation of Mr Lee’s legacy in Singapore.

Key to our transformation from a mudflat to a metropolis, we are eternally grateful to Mr Lee for the leap to the status of a developed economy.

Unwavering and determined in making sure Singapore survives with its newly found independence in 1965, he shows all Singaporeans the power of strong determination and willpower.

An icon of Singapore, we will always remember Mr Lee for his contributions.

Now and forever, history will remember Mr Lee for his foresight, intelligence, charisma and his love for our nation, Singapore.

Young and old, we Singaporeans must continue the good work Mr Lee has started and bring Singapore towards prosperity and a greater profile on the world stage.

Education and Meritocracy, these policies have benefitted many Singaporeans who have achieved social mobility.

We will always remember you, our dearest Mr Lee.

我们会永远怀念您, 建国总理李光耀先生。
DELIA LIM HWEE HWEE

Dear Mr Lee
No amount of words can express the gratitude for the sacrifices you made to make Singapore she is today.


Without your foresight and leadership, my family and I would not have a clean, green and first world Singapore to proudly call home.

Your passing is truly a great loss to us, but your legacy will live on in our hearts forever.

Once again, thank you so very much for giving your life in building up this nation with your life.

Rest in peace, Sir. Serene Tan

Dearest Mr Lee Kuan Yew


On 25th March Time : 0150am -My son and I went to Parliament and pay you our last respect.

I shared my thoughts to my 18 yrs old son ( this May he will be joining the Army) that tonight although is a long queue but WHAT Is 3 hours queuing compared to ‘YOU ‘ MR LEE who has spent and sacrifices yourself for more than ‘5 Decades ‘ with your entire life ‘Protecting ‘ us and this country Singapore from being Harm and your ‘Never Fear ‘ positive leadership just like a responsible father .

When I was reading the newspaper about You Mr Lee and there was 1paragraph recalled about you called your sister and told her you have lost some weight ,you were having the craving of eating ‘Nonya food ‘ .. Sir , my heart goes to you and felt so sad because I know Mrs Lee was no longer there to cook for your favorite food .

I then shared and read this news to my 18yrs old son and told him that -at that moment when Mr Lee told his sister about his craving for Nonya food , it must be hard for him as Mr Lee must be at the same time thinking and missed his dearest wife Mrs Lee dearly.

My Dearest Mr Lee , I want you to know you are always in my prayer and you are :

1. God Sent
2. Special and Unique
3. A Loving father to every Single
Singaporean
4. A Loving husband (as i watched on TV how you lovingly gave Mrs Lee 2kisses ) and a responsible daddy to your dearest family.

Sir, with your ‘SUPERD ‘ Leadership and with all your entire life and the sacrifices you have done for us .. May I dedicate a Special word -‘SING’ to you as how I see it describe about YOU:

SING :
S describe you as -A SINCERE AND SPECIAL MAN
I describe you as – A man that highly practice and believed in ‘ INTEGRITY’
N as in how you have thought us ‘NEVER FEAR’
G describe you as – ‘GOD SENT’ and a ‘GRACIOUS Husband and Father.

Sir, please ‘Rest In Peace ‘ and May you in heaven be united with Mrs Lee ..

We loved you,
Mdm SK YEO, Mstr Son TH

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,

You have inspired a nation. You have given us hope. You have taught us important virtues such as hard work, determination,
honesty, integrity and respect. Most of all, you have built Singapore to be a place where all Singaporeans have the
opportunities to excel and maximise their fullest potential, regardless of our social economic background. For all that you
have done for Singapore, we THANK YOU. – John Ng, CEO

Thank you for your courage, your strength. Thank you for the Singapore today. There will not be another one like you in many
years to come. R.I.P Mr. Lee. – Karyn Tan

I have been following the daily broadcasts about you and your personal and political life. As a proud citizen of Singapore, I
have read and witnessed so many of your remarkable achievements. I have lived and worked in several countries and can
understand and appreciate why you had taken certain tough and unpopular decisions along the way. I believe your vision and
determination to strive for excellence had been of tremendous benefit to all of us in Singapore. What you had done, you did
for the good of Singapore. Over the last few days, you have been described in many ways but what I can relate to from your
speeches and achievements is that you were an extraordinary human being of profound intelligence, one who was
compellingly articulate and obsessively passionate. Thank you for making Singapore what it is. May your soul rest in peace. –
Sandeep Mahawar & Family

We love YEW! Thanks for giving us a Prosperous & Metropolitan Garden City that we can call HOME. We will continue to build
on the legacy that you have left behind. – Kah Chye & Serene

On behalf of my family members, we are really grateful for your dedication in founding and building this country into a
modern, clean and multi-racial society. We will always be grateful for your hard work for Singapore and for the world. Thank
you very much Mr Lee. – Dewi

Without the great leadership of Mr. Lee Kuan Yeow and his team, we will not have the modern Singapore that we have today.
I sincerely appreciate and am thankful for Mr Lee Kuan Yeow and his team’s contributions to nation building all these years. –
Andrea Low

“Life dies, memories remain”… With deepest respect and admiration, I would like to express my thanks to Mr Lee Kuan Yew
for building and sharing this beautiful country. – Alfredo Mariscal Arcila

Thank you for all the things you’ve done to transform Singapore into such a great place to live, work and play. We are very
proud to be Singaporeans, and very proud and grateful to have you as our founding father – one who had always done things
with Singapore’s interests at heart. We also admire your continuous learning and continuous improvement spirit, and it is this
spirit that has made Singapore such a successful, prosperous, efficient and productive country that is so highly regarded by
countries all around the world! Indeed, Singapore and we, wouldn’t be where we are today without you and your leadership.
You will always be in our hearts and we will miss you! Rest in peace. – Hiew Mon Xir

My Mom & Dad were from Muar, Johor and had settled down in Singapore back in the 50’s. During that time, Mr Lee was the Legal Advisor to the labour unions, following his graduation from Cambridge University. Mr Lee would later become our very first Prime Minister and build our Nation into what it is today.
When I was growing up, my Dad would always praise Mr Lee and share all the wonderful things Mr Lee did in building the
nation. When many of my Dad’s friends decided to return to Malaysia after the separation in 1965, my Dad never even
thought of following them. He asked how could he return to Malaysia when Mr Lee had given him work stability,
opportunities to raise his children well, and provided a good education system here in Singapore. Even after the sad event
happened on 13th May 1969, my Dad didn’t think of returning to Muar, his hometown. He said he owed it to Mr Lee to stay.
And since then the whole family knew what Mr Lee really meant to him. – Azman

A great leader – love for wife, love for family and love for the nation. Rest in Peace Mr Lee KY. – Lisa Lim

Singapore has always been synonymous with Mr Lee Kuan Yew, to the point where sometimes, we almost believed that he would live forever. His “never quit” attitude in bringing continuous success to Singapore through his great leadership is unforgettable. I am much impressed by the way he spoke to youngsters, awaking and arising minds with tremendous drive
spirit and energy in his speeches. I like this quote from him on what it means to be an educated man: “My definition of an educated man is a man who never
stops learning and wants to learn”. MY SALUTE TO THE GREAT MAN WHO WILL EVER LIVE IN THE HEARTS OF SINGAPOREANS AND ITS RESIDENTS – S. Seshadri

Mr Lee Kuan Yew, a genuine political giant, a man who fought long and hard against corruption and extremism, and
transformed a politically unstable tiny island with no natural resources, and threatened by communism in the early days, into
one of the wealthiest and most secured nations in the world. Words can never express how thankful we are for what you
have done and where you have placed us in the world. May you rest in peace and God bless! – Mohd Naseer

An irreplaceable leader. His passing on will leave a big dent in the hearts of all Singaporeans. Though we knew that this day
will come, it is still very painful to lose him. Whenever I travel overseas, there is never a moment that I do not feel proud to be
holding a Red Passport, and that is all due to him. Rest In Peace Mr Lee. – Seah Chui Lian

Because of you, I can hold my Singapore passport high in the air and tell the world that I am from Singapore and I am proud to
be Singaporean. Thank you, Mr Lee, for everything you have done for Singapore and all fellow Singaporeans. You will be
missed. – Larry Tay

Singapore is respected and recognised internationally as clean and green, safe, highly efficient, meritocratic; with minimal
corruption, good racial harmony, strong harmonious union-business relationships; is a key Asian financial hub, one of the
world’s busiest seaports, the best airport, one of world’s highest GDP, etc. From Third World to First, all these were achieved
in one generation. Thanks for everything and rest in peace, Mr Lee. – Tang Wing Fatt

It was your vision and leadership that led to the success which Singapore enjoys today. You have left an enduring legacy. My
family and I owe you a debt of gratitude, and you will be deeply missed. Thank you, Mr Lee! – Carolyn Khng

Thank you for all that you’ve done for Singapore. You will forever be in our hearts. We will always respect you. May you rest in
peace. – Deep in our hearts, Lina Wee

I am a great admirer of Mr Lee Kuan Yew. He has shown great vision and determination in bringing Singapore to its current
status – a truly remarkable achievement indeed. He will remain a role model for me for the rest of my life, especially having
experienced what Singapore is, first hand, over the last six and a half years. In this moment of sadness, I pray for him. – Sriram
Narayanan

Mr Lee’s passing is a great loss to Singapore. He was our David in the landscape of Super powers. Our great sage held in awe
and sought after by world leaders. Our pride and joy.
What he has done has taken much passion, grit and determination. Singapore’s success story is a feat which is hard to repeat
and replicate. I am proud to be part of this country where I can be assured of fair treatment, equal opportunity, safety and
freedom. But we can never take these for granted.
We should be always vigilant, think of our fellow men and strive for the betterment of each other. – Juniper Chua

Words will not suffice to express our gratitude. Even as we grieve, the outpouring of heartfelt community spirit in the Padang
queue, as one united people, stands testament to your life’s achievements. We are indeed blessed to have had you as the
founding Prime Minister. I salute you Sir, for your unwavering love for your wife and selfless passion for Singapore. Thank you
Mr Lee. – Jan Woon

They say history is made by great men and I truly believe so. Mr Lee rose amongst common men during the early tumultuous
years of Singapore’s independence and shouldered a nation’s hopes and dreams. He led the nation to her success through his
wisdom, foresight, grit and a deep conviction to better the lives of fellow Singaporeans. Today, we mourn the passing of a
great man. But, we seek comfort that his name shall forever be engraved in the history of Singapore. His vision shall be
propagated by every Singaporean. Thank you Sir, for everything you have done for us all. – Lim Bing Yao

We Singaporeans are blessed to have had such a great leader. We will not be where we are today without him. He fought for
us and spent his life building a successful Singapore. Everything he did and every decision he made, was for the good of
Singapore and its people. He left behind a huge legacy, and we will continue to build on what he left for us. Thank you so
much Mr Lee Kuan Yew!! – Ang Pei Pei

We are deeply saddened by the passing of Singapore’s visionary Founding Father, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Singapore is a small
country without natural resources. Mr Lee transformed Singapore from a third world country to a first world one which is
admired by world leaders. We are grateful for his immense contributions and the legacy he has left behind. We wish his soul
will rest in peace forever. – Mohd Asaduzzaman Chowdhury

Really, how do you thank someone who has taken an entire Nation from mudflats to metropolis, from insignificant to globally respected, from Third World to First, and all in one generation? He did not do it alone, but we couldn’t have done it without him either. Tributes have been pouring in in all shapes and forms from around the world, but no amount of words, song or dance will ever be enough to describe our gratitude. So when all is said and done, all we can really offer is a feeble “Thank you, Mr Lee”. Rest well in the knowledge that we will do our utmost to ensure that your Legacy lives on. – Simon Ang

In this period of national mourning, the scene created by thousands of Singaporeans – elderly, children and people of all races and religion – queueing up in an orderly manner & waiting for hours to pay their last respects to the Late Mr Lee, has greatly touched not only Singaporeans but the whole world. It seems that even in death, Mr Lee has helped make Singapore a more
united and stronger nation. One of the beliefs of Buddhism is that death gives rise to birth – if there were no death, there would be no birth, as this is part
of any life cycle. In this period of deep sorrow, the dream of all Singaporeans will be that the spirit, wisdom, vision, integrity, dedication and commitment of the late Mr Lee can be recycled back into this world so that there will be a better world tomorrow. Lastly, my deepest and heartfelt condolences to PM Lee and his family, as well as to all Singaporeans, for the loss of such a
great man. – Daniel Tan

Over the past few days, we have all taken time to stop and reflect on what MM Lee has done to bring Singapore from a third world country to where it is today. Through this process, I come to appreciate and understand the depth and enormity of what has become of Singapore which I have taken for granted all this while. I think this is an important point for us who have not personally experienced the drastic change from the mud lands of yesteryear to the modern and prosperous Metropolis of today. Singapore could have been a very different country and our lives could have been very different if not for Mr Lee. So
much of what we have today is because of what he had done for us all. In that sense, we did not so much earn but inherited what we have and for that, he is rightly called our founding father. As the nation mourns the death of Mr Lee this past week, his passing on has united our nation as I have never seen before.
Using the words of my pastor who put it so aptly, “During your life time, you forged us into a nation. At your death, you brought us together as a family”. These words capture this moment beautifully. I feel as if Singapore has once again discovered her identity as a people and as a nation. We have all been drawn into and have personalized the narrative of a nation which is unique and extraordinary. His death has in some ways “re-founded” Singapore. Thank you so, so much Mr Lee. You have our utmost respect and gratitude. – Lam Zheng Xin

In yesterday’s Special Parliamentary Sitting to pay tribute to the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Minister Ng Eng Hen recounted this of Mr Lee: In 1968, an MP asked in Parliament, how the British withdrawal would impact Singapore. Mr Lee told Singaporeans plainly that the British bases made up 20 per cent of the GNP and tens of thousands of jobs would be lost. To overcome this drastic impact, Singaporeans would have “to adapt and adjust, without any whimpering or wringing of hands, as a way of life which they have been accustomed to over 30 years comes to an end”. When another MP followed and asked if economic aid from the British could ease the effects of the pull-out, Mr Lee’s quick and unequivocal rejoinder was that any aid should “not make us dependent on perpetual injections of aid from the outside”, that “…we cannot change our attitude to life, that the world does not owe us a living and that we cannot live by the begging bowl. The best way of meeting the problem is to go about it quietly and intelligently discussing our problems in a low key and with as little fuss and bother as possible.” It is clear that Singapore would not have come this far without Mr Lee’s brilliant and decisive leadership. Mr Lee was a tough man, and he brought the country through tough times. As a child of the 80’s, I have grown up in relative peace and prosperity as compared to those before my time. The Singapore River was already clean and flanked by gleaming skyscrapers, and Singapore, with its gushing Merlion, had made it as a First World country that many in the region were envious (and some might say, jealous) of. In school, we were constantly reminded that we should not rest on the laurels of those before us, and that we should continue to work hard to progress our nation. Singapore has come this far by being stoic and pragmatic and industrious, and we should not lose these values. We are still today, a young nation and even as we remember the achievements that have been accomplished by those before us, more importantly we should remember that hardships can come in different forms. It is wise that we do not become complacent nor divisive, and continue to stand united as a one people to weather through thick and thin. Mr Lee shall remain always a great inspiration for my generation and generations to come. – Lee Hui Ying

When Mr Lee took over as PM of Singapore in the 1960s, our country was in bad shape. There were racial conflicts in neighbouring countries which also affected us. For the poorer citizens, the living standard was worse than “third world”. There were no natural resources to depend on. Jobs were difficult to find and the pay was not enough to survive on. Gang activities, robberies, bullying and thefts were rampant. Life was tough, with nothing much to look forward to. With his great leadership, farsighted vision and strategies, determination and guts, Mr Lee:
• United people of all races and religion with an efficient and honest government.
• Assembled our Total Defence capabilities when the British left us. This in turn gave us peace for the past 50 years.
• Upgraded our education system to suit the country’s needs, and attracted so many MNCs to invest here like “Magic”. Singapore prospered in just one generation under his leadership.
• Reclaimed land at Jurong Island, Tuas and other parts of Singapore to grow our economy.
• Pushed hard and improved the people’s lives by ensuring that eventually every citizen owns his own house. Infrastructures he built were extensively comprehensive, like the MRT, hospitals, expressways, reservoirs, etc.
• Succeeded in building the Best Airport in the World, the Best Airline in the World and the No. 1 Seaport in the world. He made us the third largest oil refining centre in the world.
• Made Singapore the safest place in the world to live in.
• Succeeded in seawater desalination and used-water recycling. We are now less dependent on imported water.
• Cleaned up the Singapore river

SLNG was built by his team to secure our energy needs in the future. The wonderful things Mr Lee did for Singapore will take us a very long time to put on record. Look around you, we are no
more without “natural resources” and poor. He has given us all we need. Although we are small, we have everything that other big countries have. The strong Singapore Dollar brings us to anywhere in the world we want to. Thank you very much Mr Lee. These few days, the feeling has been sad and a bit odd. Like a family member has been lost. – Neo Lye Hock

Dear founding father,
I am really sad to hear about your passing. I wish you could celebrate SG50 with us.
Thank you for leading us to build Singapore into a beautiful garden city and give us a bright future.
I will promise to study hard, contribute to the society and make you proud.
I love you and miss you always.

Who says Singapore has no personality?
During this entire week, I was deeply touched by the numerous heartwarming moments- people extending kindness to each other in the queue, helping the elderly, random conversations and smiles exchanged between strangers, the determination of Singaporeans to pay their last respect despite the long wait, fatigue or the hot sun. Not to mention, the kindness of volunteers passing down food and water, it made me felt so well taken care of. Even Singaporeans in other parts of the world have united to pay respect to our Father of the nation in the respective countries.


Today, as the cortege passed by, despite the really strong rain, people immediately put down their umbrellas and even squatted down so that those at the back could see the cortege. I was so touched, it was such consideration. After which, everyone spontaneously sang the National Anthem in the pouring rain. I felt like I was in a scene of a movie. It was so moving.

All these moments are so indescribable, it is AMAZING. I am sure many would have felt the same way I do.

What did we do to be blessed with such a great leader who put in so much hard work that we have what we have today. Not only this, our Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is such an endearing leader. He looked so tired, yet he still personally came down to the queue to thank the people. How blessed are we to have these 2 amazing leaders who cares so much for the nation.

Living in Singapore is like living in paradise. I truly feel so fortunate to be born a Singaporean; a country with caring leaders, a country that is determined, caring, giving, respectful and grateful.

Being on exchange has opened my eyes, for the Singapore I used to take for granted, I appreciate it dearly now. I remembered fondly how when I touched down at Changi Airport from exchange, I was so overwhelmed because I was finally back home. And there is no place like home. Actually, I do think Singapore has a personality, perhaps we are just too shy to express it.

“While we struggled before to define what it meant to be a Singaporean, we suddenly realized what it meant to be one.“

In the past week, we saw unity in spirit, first hand experienced these indescribable and heartwarming moments. Perhaps, this is Lee Kuan Yew’s last gift for us- one united people. May this Singapore spirit continue to burn and live in us. Our Father, Lee Kuan Yew would be very proud and happy to see that.

Thank you Mr. Lee for your dedication and perseverance. Singapore today would not have come about without you and your visionary leadership.


I admire the ethics, principles and forward looking policies you practice and put in place, your discipline, thirst for knowledge and lifelong learning. Your never-ending passion and drive for Singapore, the difficult battles you fought and sacrifices you made for her cannot be revered enough. There is no person like you.

Lee Kuan Yew is Singapore and you made what Singapore is today, a developed nation, small yet packs a mighty punch, safe and peaceful yet brimming with opportunities, your incredible foresights and planning for the country and people, enabling us to be beneficiaries of your legacies.

No words can describe my gratitude, the emotions and sadness felt on your passing. You have fought a great battle Sir. Farewell and Rest in Peace.

Emily Tan

Dearest Mr Lee,
There is no words to describe how we feel about your passing. The only way to thank you is to keep moving forward to continue nurture what you have passed on to us. To keep you in our memories, to be united as a Nation as a Family. To live our lives with no regrets. Hard work and effort never betrays.


In the end it’s not the years in your life that count. It’s the life in your years.

Thanks to you Mr Lee, I am proud to be a Singaporean.

May I extend my heartfelt condolences to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his family on the loss of Mr Lee Kuan Yew.


Singapore is my adoptive home. I was a refugee from the Sino-Japanese War in China. Little did my parents realise that the Japanese would invade Singapore as well, in the Second World War. Born during war-torn years, I carry the name of An in Chinese, or Peace. If you had predicted a peaceful future for me at my birth, you would most likely be laughed at. However, in my new home in Singapore, and against all odds, peace has, in reality, been maintained since the end of WWII, largely through the far-sighted policies of Mr Lee.

We had split from Malaysia at our Independence and had nearly come to blows with Indonesia during Konfrontasi (1963-66), but, in the main, our multi-racial and multi-religious nation has pulled together in the face of adversity and imminent danger. Although Mr Lee has asked many sacrifices of us, we have lived up to his expectations in the hope of a better future. It looks almost as if the future has arrived in the present.

I could have ended up calling England, the USA, New Zealand or Malaysia my home but for fortuitous accidents which have root me to Singapore. I should be proud to die in the same country as Mr Lee – a lesser mortal perhaps, but sharing the honour he has brought to a country which he has created in a better world.

I am a Singaporean residing in the Netherlands for more than 10 years. My citizenship remains as Singapore. Because I feel very proud to be a Singaporean. Often, when I introduce myself at work or with friends, many people know Singapore and all the achievements. Some typical Singapore traits are the famous chewing gum ban; in the begin, people finds it amusing but later people see the need!


It was you, Mr. Lee who created a successful country and made us lift our heads up high where ever we are. I personally admire your wisdoms and the passion you have which gave you continued energy to fight for a world class country among our neighbours. I thank you sincerely.
Evelyn Ng

Dear Mr Lee, Sir


I have never met you but since your passing, I have watched your speeches and read much about you in this recent week. Like many Singaporeans, I felt an emotional attachment with you. I am deeply grateful for your tremendous dedication in building Singapore and your immense love and passion for her people. You are the blood that pulse through the veins of Singapore. You have taught is what 饮水思源 means – I now understand the source and importance of our water and appreciate the greenery we enjoy. I will always strife to behave like a first world citizen living in a first world oasis. May we endeavor to maintain this city in a garden as passionately as you did and teach our children to conserve our water supply. You leave behind a legacy that shall be passed on to many future generations to come. May your soul rest peacefully in heaven, your spirit lies in the hearts of Singaporeans. With deepest gratitude…

Dear Mr Lee
I am writing this from my room in a 3-room flat in Ang Mo Kio. I can own this home because of you, because of all you have stood for, believed in, sacrificed for. No amount of words can fully describe the depth of my gratitude. Your love and devotion to Mrs Lee has touch my heart so deeply, a love so true and committed. There are things that will be taught to us and will make such a deep impact, and these are not by words but by your actions, your living it out, the examples you set.
I am deeply honored, thankful, grateful, privilege to have you as the leader of Singapore. There will never be another Lee Kuan Yew like the one Singaporeans know.


Thank you, Mr Lee.
Sum Wei Yee

When I was a child, my father would insist that my sibling and I listen to Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s National Day Rally speeches on television. My father wanted us to learn to speak well (i.e. in grammatically-correct English), speak with conviction and hold the attention of an audience. I am not sure how much of these skills I have managed to develop over the years, but the memory of Mr Lee’s strength as an orator, his tenacity, and dedication to excellence will stay with me and continue to inspire me.

Sumi

Dear Mr Lee,


Thank you for the sacrifices you had to make to build this nation and for the courage to stand up to your dissidents. You fought bravely for your convictions and did not “suffer fools”….and why should we indeed suffer those who do not place the highest good before our self-interest.

Ultimately choosing to benefit the masses will eventually benefit oneself as we are part of the same fabric.

You will always be larger than life itself and your passing on, while leaving a vaccum, does also leave a lasting and solid legacy for Singaporeans to sustain and improve upon with pride and competency.

Thank you once again for enabling us to take pride in being a Singaporean. Please continue to watch over us in your spiritual form and protect this island, our home.

Love & Light,
Sean Foo Suan An

Dearest Mr Lee,
I am deeply grief since 23 Mar 15. This whole week of mourning is extremely difficult as we still cannot accept the fact that you have left us. All of us wanted you to be present in SG50.


We have seen how you have transformed Singapore, battle all the challenges and fight against the odds for our independence. We are where we are now, because of you, our great and one & only founding father of Singapore.

You have spent all your life to build and to create Singapore. You have laid the foundation and have given us a country that we can call it our nation, a HDB housing that we can call it our home, a bilingual education that we can call it our strength, not forgetting our water supply and public transport, etc. We are the beneficiaries of your legacy.

It is a country that is well recognised and respected by all countries across the globe. You made us feel proud of our country and proud to be Singaporean. 感谢、感激、感恩.

As long as there is Singapore, there is Mr Lee Kuan Yew. We will always remember you in this generation, next generation and many generations ahead.

I am glad that I was able to pay my last resoect to you at the Parliament House , pen tributes at Raffles Institutions and Tanjong Pagar Community Centre, involved in your funeral service on 29 Mar 15 at the beginning and at the end.of the route.

Current PM (Lee Hsien Loong ), we know this week has been extremely difficult for you.. It is going to be very challenging for you going forward to carry on with your beloved father’s legacy and to build on it to the next level . You can make it. Take care and 加油!

Dear Mr. Lee Kuan Yew,
I am 61 years old and have experienced the growth of Singapore since the day you shouldered the unenviable responsibilities of building our tiny island nation. It was a monumental task with no room for error. We had no industries, no agriculture, high unemployment rate, racial tension, low literacy rate, not-so-nice neighbors and practically no foreign reserves to speak of. Many of our neighbors were waiting to see us fail. We didn’t. You led us out of the swamps and built Singapore into a 1st world country in less than 50 years. Your vision, perseverance, determination, intelligence and raw courage saw us through. What you did was much more than a miracle. Sometimes I wonder whether you have a crystal ball.


You built Singapore on all fronts which enabled us to overcome any obstacles from any directions. To call you a giant among men is an understatement. You are a true nation builder who is rarely seen in history. We fortunate to have you.

To thank you for what you did is hardly enough but I assure you that we will continue your good works and keep you in our hearts and minds at all time.

Rest in Peace, Mr. Lee.

Dear Mr. Lee
Thank you for the many things you have done for Singapore.
I feel that your biggest contribution to Singapore is leading Singapore to independence. You had made a lot of effort to make Singapore what it is today, from a third world country to this famous red dot. You never gave up this country when times were bad. Instead, you worked even harder, leading Singaporeans through ups and downs. I cannot thank you enough for whatever you had done for our country, making it glow in just a few decades. Always remembering you, founding father of Singapore, in our hearts.

Where the wild wind blows
Where my heart stilled
Under the blanket of sorrows
Beckons me within
The days of passing
The days of mourning
Torturous to mine soul
Where the wild wind blows


Rest In Peace Sir

Dear Mr Lee, thank you for all your hard work and sacrifices you have given to Singapore. There are no words that can express my gratitude and respect I have for you. You have devoted your whole life carving a nation, not for yourself, but for the people of Singapore and our future generations. 50 years ago you shed your tears for Singapore, now we Singaporeans and other parts of the world are shedding their tears for the loss of a true giant leader. It will be very hard to find another remarkable world leader like yourself Mr Lee. Without you, there will be no modern Singapore. Singapore would still be a little red dot among the other big nations. Now Singapore is a big commercial hub, being able to work collaborately with the other big nations in the world. You are not only a widely respected leader but also a kind hearted and soft man, whom many older generations have shared their beautiful encounters they had with you. You will be remembered for many generations to come. Thank you once again Mr Lee. Rest in peace.

I am in that generation of fortunate Singaporeans who have benefited the most from Mr Lee’s leadership. We did not suffer through the formative years of the nation in the early sixties and were largely shielded from the difficulties that the nation faced after Singapore’s separation from Malaysia. Yet, we have benefited from being in a safe and secure English speaking nation with a good quality of life. We benefited from the meritocratic policies which allowed us to train in our chosen profession-medicine. We were sent overseas to the best centres in the world to train with government support. We returned to a much admired healthcare system to do good work. Thank you Mr Lee for our little country that is big in the world’s eyes, for our lives and for giving us a livelihood and a future. May you rest in peace.

Dear Founding Father Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


Thank you for making it possible for my grandparents and parents to make it through the hardships of olden Singapore. For that, I am grateful to you, for I will not be here writing this piece of tribute without your wise leadership for your people.

You do not know me for who I am, but it does not matter. I know what you have done for us. That is, well, important. You built Singapore to be clean, green, efficient and organised for the benefit for all of us. This has made me so proud to be part of Singapore. Maybe this is why I had decided to join the civil service 13 years ago, and I never looked back since. You paved the road for my generation, so that we can do more to continue your legacy.

I was deeply saddened as I listened to PM Lee addressed the nation about your demise on 23 March. It must be really hard for him. It was, for me. I came to the realisation that you are, so much a part of my life, only with your passing on. Indeed, I felt as if an important piece of my beautiful puzzle has gone missing. When I paid my respects to you this morning at the Parliament House, finally, I could choke back my tears no more.

Thank you, Sir, for all your hard work and giving your all, your life, to us. We will stay strong. May you rest in peace.

My deepest condolences to PM Lee and the family of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

Dear Mr Lee,


We would like to thank you for building up Singapore so that we could walk with pride and dignity as Singaporean, able to stand up against our peers in the world.

The Singapore branding has come to be associated with efficiency, trustworthiness and honesty. It is these traits that allow us to punch above and beyond what a small country could do.

In a way the history of Singapore Urological Association mirrors the history of Singapore. We are but a small group of urologists compared to the other Asian countries, let alone the rest of the world. Under the meritocratic system you have created and armed with scholarship by the government, we were sent to top medical centres in the world to learn new skills and technology so that we could bring them back to Singapore and use it for the good of our people. It also helps to put Singapore at the cutting edge of medicine and biotechnology, far beyond most Asian countries. The ties that we have established with experts overseas further seal our fame as a leading regional centre for medical excellence.

We always look beyond the shores of Singapore as you have always proposed and thus our annual local meeting had expanded to become a regional type meeting with overseas experts coming over to share their knowledge, an opportunity that is hard to come by unless you fly over to the Americas or Europe.

Thank you Mr Lee for building up a stable and cohesive nation, gives us immense opportunities beyond our imagination and expand our horizon to look further than our own limitation.

Rest in peace, Sir.

Dear Mr. Lee Kuan Yew,
You had been an inspiration and the pride of all Singaporeans. We cannot thank you enough for your wholehearted contribution to Singapore and Singapore will not be what it is today without You.


Thank you for the tears you wept when we separated from Malaysia. Thank you for the hard work in achieving racial harmony, meritocracy and economic stability. Thank you for believing in your people and leading us for many decades no matter how desperate the situation seemed. Thank you for always putting Singapore’s interest first, always looking out for her until the very end.

Sir, you will be dearly missed and Singapore will never be the same without you. May you rest in peace and continue believing in us, your people, as we work hard for an even brighter Singapore. God bless you.
Rey Chen

I was born on 26th Oct 1955 – Pioneer Generation, 2nd Class


I grew up during the tumultuous years of pre and post independence, experienced the racial riots first hand as fighting and killings happened just outside my primary school compound while we were in class, the separation from Malaysia, the British pullout and much more.

I first saw Mr Lee Kuan Yew when my father brought me, a young boy of 7 or 8 years old, to listen to him speak somewhere near the old Change Alley area (I can’t remember exactly where). The first thing that struck me was his booming voice and his body actions, especially his hands, and his facial expressions. He spoke powerfully and with emotion. I did not fully understood the meaning of what was spoken but he gave me the impression that he was a leader, a great leader, that he was someone who would fulfill his promises, someone who would guide us and take care of us and fight for us.

All through the years, my impression of him had not changed from the above. In fact, as I grew up, became more mature and was exposed to lives and conditions in other countries I began to appreciate Mr Lee Kuan Yew even more. His vision and foresight, his belief in himself, his team and his people, his determination to accomplish whatever he sets out to do or achieve, his meticulous planning to achieve his goals for the country, his righteousness and much much more.

What he has instilled most in me, and I believe in most Singaporean of my generation is the need to continually strive to be the best through hard work, honesty, self-sacrifice and compassion to compliment the skills and intelligence needed to perform any job, any role. Most of all, I will forever remember what he had been drumming to all of us from the first day, that we must continually strive not only to be, but to remain, “one united people regardless of race, language or religion”.

Mr Lee Kuan Yew, go in peace knowing that you had achieved what you set out to do and much much more. You had put in place both the hardwares as well as the softwares for the current and future generations of Singaporeans to thrive.

Thank you and God Bless!

五六十年代，您是我們的鬥士，帶領新加坡爭取獨立； 六七十年代，您成為驅動者，帶領我們拼經濟，搞建設； 七八十年代，您有如商人，帶領我們走出國門到海外投資； 九十年代，您明智的交棒給下一代領導班子而成為我們的護航者； 您為這個國家和人民做得太多。。。太多了！ 是時候我們必須負起責任繼續傳承您所奠定的國策和永垂不朽的精神； 安息吧國父，望您在天之靈看到您的子民是多麼的尊敬和愛戴您！

Dear Sir,
I regret that I was not able to bid you farewell. Nonetheless I stayed up late in a bid to watch the live stream of your funeral.


Sir, you are an inspiration to us all. Singapore did not deserve you, it was too small a stage for you. I do not know what Singapore did to deserve you, but it was our luck that we did. I thank you, founding father, for the security and the prosperity you have brought to our nation. Whilst your policies were never short of critics, many of us have benefited from them unknowingly. Sir, even whilst people of my generation have been said to be unacquainted to the trials and the hardship your generation has been through to secure our future, your legacy lives on in us. For that, we are forever grateful. Indeed, without your work on Singapore, many of us would not be where we are.

Sir, there will never be another like you. Singapore was too small a stage. Even many have known your name but not Singapore’s. Yet, we, your people, will remember you not merely for your wit and your combative nature, your frankness and honesty that has earned the respect of world leaders, but we will remember you for the life that you have sacrificed to build this country from scratch, for the tears you shed for us. Today, we shed tears for your passing.

Sir, if not for you, i would not be in the UK studying law now. I have seen you only once whilst having a lunch at Raffles Hotel. I remember being surprised at how tall you were. Sir, even though I do not know you personally, I will aspire to live by your virtues. And even though I have not witnessed first hand the development you have brought to Singapore, I am grateful for the comfort that I was born into. Singapore lives on, a grateful people who will continue your legacy.

Sir, you were too big for Singapore. We never deserved you. You were not a man of God, but perhaps you were a man from God. Sir, we will fly the flag proudly wherever we are, wherever we are planted.

Rest in peace, we will continue your legacy.

Dear Sir,
We like to express our heartfelt gratitude and sincere appreciation for all that you have done for Singapore.
Like many others, we also belong to the generations who have not undergo much hardships or sufferings like our pioneers. Regretably, we only got to know you better now. Within the short five days of mourning, we learnt a lot – of how hard you had fought for the nation, the numerous intriguing & wise speeches you made, as well as the sentimental side of you.
You have definitely made enormous contributions to our society. Without you, we will not have this safe, beautiful, leading global city we called home.
Your wisdom & vision, along with endless determination & selflessness, have made Singapore a country we are all proud of. We are truly thankful beyond words…


Dear Sir, may you rest in peace. We will continue to be a good Singapore citizen and your legacy will be passed down to our children. We will remember you forever.

Yours sincerely,

Our founding father, your passing is a loss to Singapore – a land that you have lived, led and loved. A great leader, you selflessly led with your tenacity, foresight and brought this once little dot on the earth surface to a successful, thriving and prosperous world-known first class nation.
A strong advocate in equality, you strive for living together harmoniously in diversity, and reached out to everyone, regardless of race, language or religion. Your faith, persistence and great foresight during your reign still continue to benefit and allow us, your fellow Singaporeans, to reap benefits, from your sacrifice and labour.
My father once said,”Both your mother and I are lowly educated, yet we have a home to call our own, and two children who are educated and successful. We owe it to Mr Lee. He has contributed to a roof over our head, a stable ground for us to rely on in times of crisis, and he raised my children up well.”
A man of great strength and leadership in the political realm, you show us not just your love for Singapore, but also to your courage to display your tender loving care as a sentimental man to your late wife. Indeed, a sign of a man’s strength is how gently he loves his wife. I am deeply touched by how sweet and loving you are to the woman behind your back all these years – your very own pillar of support.
Just like how you celebrate the life of your late wife with your touching eulogy, we, your Singaporeans, your fellow countrymen and women, celebrate your life today.
Your contribution to Singapore can never be simply summed up in these few words and so does my gratitude to you. Without you, there will be no Singapore like today.
Thank you for gracing us with your lifetime.

Dear Mr Lee,
Few years ago, my family and I were living in Shanghai due to my husbands work. As a Singaporean living abroad, I kept connected to my homeland through constant updates on news and articles on the Internet.
As I see less and less of you in public appearances, I tell myself that should the day come, I will fly back home to personally send you off.
The good news is, my husband got posted back mid 2013 and it was a relief to be able to still catch you on TV a couple of times.
So on the first day of your lying in state. I was determined to go regardless of being told the arduous wait. As I was getting ready my 10 year old son said he wish to tag along, even though he knew the wait was 4 hours or more. I was touched. He asked me what to wear, I pondered for a while and told him to dress as if meeting Mr Lee in person. Without a word he dashed to his room and in few minutes came out in his suit which he wore for his solo guitar performance. I was totally stunned and asked him why he chose that attire. His reply was I quote “He was the Prime Minister! I have to look my best!” Trying hard to hold back my emotion, I told him it’s good that he thinks that way but we would be standing in the hot son for a while so will be too much to be in so many layers. Reluctantly he changed into something less formal, but still nothing short of long sleeves and long pants.
During the 4 hours wait, my son who is an iPad freak didn’t say a word about being bored, not even the slightest attempt to ask if he can use my iPhone to entertain himself. All he brought was a box of nerd candy, which he constantly poured a few every now n then to pop into his mouth.
When it was finally our turn, words can’t even describe the mixed feelings I had. Gratitude, admiration, sadness, emptiness, all filled me up in that short 30 seconds we stood in front of your coffin. As I choked up we bowed and said our goodbyes.


Mr Lee thank you again for all that you have done, we will miss you dearly, you will live in our hearts forever.
May you rest in peace.

This week, Singapore declared a national week of mourning.
This week, Singapore was deeply saddened by your passing.
This week, hundreds of thousands of Singaporeans formed the longest queue along Singapore River and Padang to pay tribute to you.
But to me,
This week marks a celebration of your life.
This week is an awakening week for the younger generation to understand how you have transformed Singapore from nothing to everything that we take for granted.
This week, our hearts are truly connected as One, the people are united as One.
This week marks the most remarkable and impactful week for Singapore in 2015.
No single SG50 celebration event can be as meaningful as this week.
I was born in 1965 and I am proud to be part of Singapore’s growth, and to be able to witness the transformation of Singapore as well.
No words can express my gratitude to you, dear Founding Father. THANK YOU.
You will be deeply missed and dearly cherished in our hearts for years…
Prayers to PM Lee and family.

Thank you, Mr Lee, for making Singapore a success – for sowing the seeds and ploughing the land so that we, the following generations, are able to enjoy the shade and the fruits those trees bear. And it is probably fitting to say so seeing how you were a firm believer in turning Singapore into a city in a garden. We are, without a doubt, extremely fortunate to have been blessed with a group of founding fathers who managed to turn Singapore into a modern miracle through sheer tenacity, logic and foresight, and all that Singapore has become is definitely the result of their hard work.
Thank you, Mr Lee, for inspiring the following generations to follow in your footsteps and keep pushing Singapore to greater heights, for we know that this country that you’ve built on all your life is capable of even more.
Thank you, Mr Lee, for this country that I can proudly call home. Your contributions to this nation will never, and can never, be forgotten. Even after many generations, we would still be remembering the humble beginnings of this fishing village, and through it all, the mastermind of a modern metropolis.
Thank you, Mr Lee, for all that you’ve dedicated your life to. May you rest in peace.
Ho Wan Qi

Dear Mr Lee
I first came to Singapore in 1989 for my first job after leaving my hometown in Ipoh. Since then, I never looked back. I admire the values and principles that you integrate in your administration of the nation. The fairness and equality of each citizens regardless of race, religion, background, etc….To me, Singapore is Lee Kuan Yew and Lee Kuan Yew is Singapore. I cannot imagine a Singapore without you.
At times, I envy the people of Singapore for having you as their leader. I admire your passion, and your desire, grit and determination to make Singapore a better place to live in; a place you can call home. You lived simply but with a big heart!
I am truly glad that I get to live in a Singapore with your presence for more than two decades. You will be missed but your spirit will continue to motivate the people of Singapore to continue growing this nation that you have built with your life.
Thank you Mr Lee Kuan Yew, thank you for Singapore. You have done remarkably well, beyond words can described.
Happy reunion with your wife and rest in peace Sir!
H. Wong


I am extremely grateful to Sir Lee Kuan Yew. I wouldn’t be where I am and my family wouldn’t be where we are, if not for Sir Lee Kuan Yew’s forward-looking policies.
My father chose to make Singapore his home because he felt this is where his children will get the best education with no fear of cultural dilution since Singapore is strongly rooted in Asian values. My father used to say and still says, Lee Kuan Yew has made this place a land of opportunity – you must work really hard and make the most of every opportunity you get. He has made Singapore a place where anyone can reach their true potential. This is not true in most countries across the world. You must respect this and be grateful for what you have received. You must create so much value in whatever work you do that Singapore is proud of you.
Sir Lee Kuan Yew, your governance standards, your policies, your speeches, your personality, your contribution, your life, was, is and shall be an inspiration and example for many generations to come.
My family and I thank you for being who you were.
May God bless your soul and grant you eternal peace and rest.

Dear Mr Lee,
I belong to the generation that got to enjoy the luxury of everything that you did and still, get to see you, pay my utmost and final respect to you and together with all Singaporeans, joined you on your last journey with us. No words can explain how fortunate I am, how grateful and how blessed I am to be a part of this. Nothing could change what you mean to Singaporeans. We Singaporeans will always remember you.


Writing this is the only thing that I can do to show how much I really appreciate as a Singaporean. There is nothing that we can do to be worth comparing to everything that you’ve given up for us. It is not even comparable to 0.01% of what you did for us. We’re eternally grateful and we’ll never be able to repay what you’ve done. It is only apt that we follow your values, pass it on and keep Singapore going. Because that’s the only thing that we can do and we’ll still be indebted to you.

There’re still so much more I needed to learn about Singapore’s history. I never had been through what my
