In Memoriam: Lee Kuan Yew

A commemorative exhibition in honour of the late Mr Lee will be held at the Glass Atrium at level 2 of the National Museum (93 Stamford Road). Running from 25 March 2015 to 24 May 2015, revisit Singapore’s formative years and his pivotal role in our nation-building journey through stirring photographs, audio-visual recordings and artefacts.

These artefacts will be retained and curated in the soon-to-be revamped Permanent Galleries of the Museum as well. This will open in Aug/Sept 2015.
