Dearest Lee Kuan Yew
Lee Kuan Yew is true hero and extraordinary fighter in Singapore. His master of strategy & knowledge is indeed recognised and honoured by the world leaders. It helps to put a tiny island, Singapore on the map to the First World.


Lastly, We, Singaporeans thank you, Lee Kuan Yew so much for protecting, improving & transforming Singapore into the Vibrant Garden City where every families enjoy the green environment. I know it’s not enough saying Thank you. But we never forget LKY’s legacy.

We will miss LKY so much. Hope LKY will meet his beloved wife who she is waiting for him in heaven.

Good bye & Farewell LKY..

Dear Mr Lee,
Your unbridled ambition to transform Singapore is clearly manifested in your unwavering drive to establish an efficient and transparent government. While critics may disapprove of your sometimes hard handed policies, I believe that you always had the interest of Singapore at heart. Your prowess as a statesman remains unrivaled, your patriotism for Singapore remains unmatched, your wisdom and vision — unchallenged. Your contributions and love for the country shall not be in vain, because Singapore and Singaporeans will take your passing in stride. With each passing day, you will serve as the reminder that we are the torchbearers who will determine the future of Singapore.

Thank you for everything.

Yours truly,
Nicholas Tey

Although I am on the other end of the world studying and running in America, the news of our founding father’s passing hit me hard. I felt connected in spirit with fellow Singaporeans in this time of grief, including the 1.5 million who queued many hours to pay tribute to Mr Lee Kuan Yew. From what I have heard, hardly anyone complained despite the hours of waiting under the hot sun. Tears streamed down my face as I watched on YouTube Dr Ng Eng Hen’s speech in parliament. I was in awe when New Zealand’s parliament dedicated 11 minutes to acknowledge his wisdom, foresight, and courage especially during in the early years; such is the global reach of our first Prime Minister.


How does all this happen for one man? I believe the answer boils down to character. Yes, his achievements in taking Singapore from swampland to one of the wealthiest nations worldwide, as well as his efforts in making Singapore one of the safest and cleanest places where our children can run free, are outstanding. However, these results are only a reflection of his inner soul: a steadfast leader genuinely looking out for the best interests of a nation, and a loving husband who shall now be reunited with his wife.

Thank you Mr Lee Kuan Yew for giving up your life to serve Singapore. We are so grateful for what Singapore is today and will be tomorrow. Singaporeans are now more united than ever in sorrow, but we must also be united in celebrating your legacy going forward.

I did not went through the period of turmoil but watching the world today still gives me the jitters of what we could have been with poor leadership.


You believed in building good relationships with the rest of the world, and I really appreciates that I’m always welcomed wherever I go. It opened up a world of opportunities for the people.

Everyone have a chance for proper education but not everyone can excel academically. Our society has been most forgiving and I’m glad that we are moving forward by giving due recognition to skills mastery.

Your take on productivity was simple then: “”Productivity means the ability to use man and machine in such a cooperative way that you produce more products per man hour, of a superior quality, than any man can do.”” In today’s context, it has somehow evolved into cutting manpower at all levels, keeping the cost low. It’s funny how Productivity can be achieved both ways. Doing more with less? Or the less do more?

Your demand for efficiency has manifested in the way Singaporean communicates. Singlish is born because it is an efficient form of English. It is the most effective way to communicate regardless of race, language or religion, at least on this tiny island.

Although chewing gum is a lifestyle that we do not have, I appreciates that we are spared the agony of pulling sticky gum from the sole of our shoes.

Thank you, Mr Lee, and the Pioneers, for bringing order to what was once a chaotic island.

Majulah Singapura.
Chua Wee Ser

You dedicated your life to lead Singapore to where it is today and put in place monumental changes which have shaped Singapore for the better.


You built a strong team and found tangible solutions to tackle the complex problems of a young nation. We will not take for granted the roof we have over our heads, the peace and harmony that we share and the beautiful garden city that we can call our home.

You led a frugal life and showed us how to cherish the things that matter. You lived a life enriched with meaning, fueled with passion. Your story also reminds us of how love is beautiful and how couples should support each other, through good times and bad, in sickness and in health.

You showed us what it means to serve and give of oneself. You worked tirelessly and no problem was ever considered too small for your attention. You said that “”no man is an island”” and that Singaporeans need to place their individual interests aside and steer their efforts towards building community and a strong Singapore. Life throws difficult moments our way and challenges us to make important decisions. Thank you for teaching us about courage and tenacity and for stressing the need for clarity in what we do.

Thank you for your vision and for being an inspiration.
We are privileged to have learnt so much from you and we want to let our children know about all that you have done.
We are Singapore because of you.
You are no longer with us but your legacy will live on. Majulah Singapura!

Rest in peace Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

Dear Mr Lee
Thank you for your selfless actions, enormous vision and values. Your actions speak so much and what you have done for our nation, economy, racial harmony, stability, environment and the list goes on. The tears the whole nation cries for the past six days can never be compared to the amount of energy and sweat you had done for us.


My parents have always share with me and my siblings what you had done for the nation. My parents explained why you had to do what you had done. I grow up appreciating trees, clean water supply and sanitary facilities, smooth roads and pavements, HDB flats and so many more. There is nowhere on earth I would rather be.

You are such a giant and yet gentle to reach out to the weak and helpless. I will forever be grateful to you. I can’t do great things. What I can do is to tell my children and hopefully their children what you have done for Singapore, to maintain the racial harmony you have so preciously protected and to do all they can to continue improving themselves so that they can do their part on ensuring the stability of Singapore you have so painstakingly created.

I always love watching you during National Day Parades when you looked at the sky. I also enjoyed listening to your speeches. It may be long speeches but they are by far, the most inspiring ones I’ve heard. I love the occasional humour you injected into your speeches too.

I always trust you and the governing bodies of Singapore. Even though you were no longer PM but it was a relief to know you were always there. I feel so much pain and loss at your departure that I could not celebrate my birthday yesterday. 50yrs ago, you cried for us and 50yrs later, we cry for you.

Finally, I do hope you will be able to find Mrs Lee in heaven. I remember watching an interview you had and Mrs Lee was wiping your forehead during interval. There was so much love and respect that you and Mrs Lee showed for one another. I will never forget the scene when you gave your final kisses for Mrs Lee at her funeral. It was so painful to see you grieve.

To you, our founding father, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, I may not be able to do much but I will do every bit I can to protect the very elements you had fought courageously for us all your life. I will never forget you and what you had done.

May you rest in peace but please watch over us from up there.

Your forever grateful Singaporean signing off.

Dearest Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
We have seen many accolades from presidents of various countries to the man in the streets which i do not need ţo list again. Thank you for making Singapore a brilliant city. You have touch us all one way or another. Your vision have enable us to have a home and you have protected Singapore & Singaporeans from adversities, threats & discrimination. You stood toe to toe against the superpower nations who called Singapore a “”just little red dot”” and made Singapore successful. In my 20 years of global travels, your name Mr Lee Kuan Yew has became synonymous with Singapore and i can sense that some of the foreigners i spoke to, are envious that Singapore has such a great leader. Every year, I looked forward to seeing you on national day and listen to you speak during national day rally. You have inspired me to do Singapore proud.


There’s so little Singapore younger generation knew about you but this is enough for many that i have seen queuing with me for hours to pay our final respect to you at the Parliament House. Many young and old are determine to queue under the punishing weather for hours, is prove of your legacy you left on us Singaporeans. I thank you. And now it’s time for us to carry the torch and take this nation to greater heights.

Although I do not have the chance to tell you in person, i like you to know that you are loved and greatly missed. Singapore has lost our most beloved leader and The Soul of the nation. Rip

Son of Singapore

No words can describe the loss and grief we are experiencing now as a nation – at the passing of one of the greatest, most respected man – not only of the nation, but the world. It was only through the recent readings of the many articles written of Mr Lee Kuan Yew this past week, that made me realize with tears how much he had toiled his whole life for Singapore, even in his old age, just so that we, Singaporeans, can lead a better life. The fact that in his whole life – even till old, he continued working into the wee hours of the morning for our nation’s sake while the whole of Singapore is sleeping; his kind heart, and frugal ways of living, despite his status, really touched me deeply.


Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew, you have touched each and every of our hearts in so many special ways – for all your countless selfless sacrifices; all the sweat, blood, tears and hardships you ever had to go through for this nation; for the hope, pride and future you have given to this nation; for building Singapore to become the clean and green and beautiful country it is today, no amount of ‘thank-you’s is ever enough, but from the bottom of my heart, thank you.

You will live forever in our hearts and memories. Rest in peace, Sir!

安息吧，李光耀
你曾说，你不希望以政治家的身份被人铭记。同知识、道德和精神上的满足相比，尘世的一切荣耀与成功都是转瞬即逝的。


人们终将长久地纪念你， 一个为几百万人创造了最大福祉的伟人，一个深爱妻子的丈夫。

在这个时刻，你终成一个普通的老人，安静地逝去了。所有人终究都将面对死亡。 你曾经自问，如果可以从头再来，你的人生旅程会有所不同吗？我也不禁问自己同样的问题。

你说，人生变幻无穷。前途充满着未知数。选择了一条道路，就必须向前走，不能再回头。你说，重要的是，不应失去对生命的热爱。

在我生命的转折点，我选择来到新加坡。在这里，我和我生命中最重要的人一起相伴，留下人生中最珍贵的记忆。没有你和你的远见， 多少人的人生将会不同。我也可能会是个不同的人，生活在不同的地方。

在将来的某一天， 在一个安静的时刻，我们会重温自己生活的点点滴滴。我们会记得我们是幸运的，在你和你的同辈人创建的这片土地上，工作，生活，照顾老人和子女，孕育希望。

我知道我应该为我现在所拥有的一切感到欣慰。在这最后告别的时刻，我的心充满了敬意和感伤。

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
How are you? With the uncountable blessings worldwide, hope you are resting peacefully with your wishes fulfilled. Overlooking on the thoughts and visits pouring in for you, it is a testament to how great an influence you were to all of us. I miss you.


I look up to your decisiveness, vision and determination among all the other values that you have positively imparted to us. My heartfelt gratitude to your care and concerns to Singapore, we citizens and our future throughout the years. Snippets I can recall of you fondly displays your beautiful passion – the passion towards merger with Malaysia for our survival, the passion to spearhead Singapore to independence, the passion to improve our fertility rates and bilingualism. You treated us like your precious baby, moulding every area – defence, housing, education, job employment, infrastructure into the success we can enjoy now.

Singapore’s well-being was a constant worry in your mind, thus be rest assured, for we will continue the prosperity you strive for!

To me, you were more than our founding father. As I quote: “”Anyone can be a father, but it takes someone special to be a dad.”” I feel like you may even satisfy a greater place than that in my heart. I will remember you, my role model.

With hugs and best wishes,
A thankful Singaporean
Peh Zhi Rui

Dearest Father of Singapore, Mr Lee Kwan Yew


It is a blessing for Singapore to have a great leader like you, leading us through rough times to become a prosperous country today. Without your great vision, commitment and leadership, we would not become the First world country today.

My family and myself are fortunate as we need not go through the war and the separation from Malaysia where there were so much uncertainty, yet we get to enjoy the fruit of your labor. Every time the plane touches down in Changi Airport when I come back from overseas, I know that I am ‘HOME’.

You brought Singapore together during our independence and even now, when you are gone. Throughout these few days, people queued for hours under the sun and the moon to pay tribute to you. The Nation grieve for your demise. No words or actions can express the appreciation for what you had done for us, Singaporean.

For generations to come, you will be remembered when we look at the garden city, the education that we will receive and the roof over our heads and your legacy.

Every Singaporean will remember 23rd of March 2015. The day you left us. However, though you are gone, your spirit will be carried on.

A big ‘Thank You’ from the bottom of my heart.
Ang Cheng Tee Travis

Dear Sir,
As I queued up on Wednesday to pay you respect, I witnessed silently how many others have come to pay their respects. It dawned upon me that many of us have benefited from what you provided for our country – a meritocratic society where everyone is given an opportunity to succeed regardless of race, language or religion. It is memorable to see thousands queue up to pay you respect and this shows that what you left behind is a legacy and a living testimony that our country is united and we will remain one Singapore.

You are a great leader and the generation that I live in have much to emulate from you. I hope that my generation and the generations after will continue to remember the struggles you had and the peace and security your sacrifice have provided. We will reflect on your speeches and words of wisdom… we will miss you and you will always remain in our memories. Thank you and may you rest in peace. Lionel Chen

I was very astonished when you touched my hand during your visit to Aljunied when I was a little kid. Although that was the first and last personal encounter with you, I can never forget your loving smile and your sharp eyes that looked at me.


I never missed all the broadcast of your speeches and the interviews of you. Your thoughts and knowledge of the nation and the world, your vision and strategy for Singapore and your views of your team, above all, your passion for Singapore, your love for the people, your iron fist captured my heart and mind.

You are man of your word, what you said you would do for Singapore you did it. Singapore has successfully transformed from Third World to First world. Now every Singaporean has good housing environment, equal education opportunities, high quality public healthcare, clean water, beautiful parks and river within city and world renown transport system. Many foreigners admired what we Singaporean have and the benefits that we enjoyed.

Your visionary thoughts and wisdom about the world affairs, your public relationships with the country leaders in the world, has gained us the respect and acceptance of the world. Just look at the ease of travelling with a Singapore passport that is well received all over the world and the number of FTAs that Singapore has.

Personally, I benefited from your education plan for Singapore and your foresight of bilingualism. I have the opportunities working in fortune 50 global companies, leading project teams that span across US, EMEA, China and Singapore. I am very grateful to you for providing an excellent institutional system that I could gain knowledge and ability to work and communicate with cross-cultural teams.

I read your book about you learning Chinese language and watched your active participation in the parliament in your later years. They encourage me that there is nothing too late in life nor too old to do anything. You are my role model – your wisdom and humility, your passion for Singapore, your truthful and faithful leadership, your romantic love for your wife, your caring heart for your children and grandchildren, and your agape love for other people.

I pray generations after generations of Singaporean will inherit the great values that you imparted to us, and people in Singapore continue to be united as One Singapore regardless of parties. “We, the citizens of Singapore, pledge ourselves as one united People, regardless of race, language or religion, to build a democratic society, based on justice and equality so as to achieve happiness, prosperity and progress for our nation”.

Thank you for your thoughts and plans that you have for Singapore and for us, thoughts and plans for our welfare and peace, thoughts and plans to give us all a future and a place we proudly call Home.

Thank you for giving your life to Singapore, tirelessly serve us and not to be served.

Thank you our founding father Lee Kuan Yew. I love you.
Sophia Loh

Lee Kuan Yew, you were a great man and a visionary who single handedly took Singapore from nothing to where it is today. I admire your courage, strong will and tenacity which are core ingredients of a great believer that “”We Can Make It”” despite the odds and unforeseeable.


You had given so much of your life to making Singapore a better place to live and thrive. Singaporeans are very lucky people who get to enjoy all the privileges and luxuries on this small island that you had once toiled laboriously and relentlessly in the strong belief and faith that one day it would bear fruits for its people.

Singaporeans are totally spoilt by the convenience of amenities and facilities in every nook and corner of the garden city. There are underground links to everywhere you want to go without getting wet if it rains – from HDB to shopping centre and from shopping centre to another shopping centre.

You had brought unity and harmony amongst the peoples of Singapore given the multi-cultural and multi-racial make up.

Your memory will live forever. When I think of Singapore, I think of you. I am forever grateful for what you had done without which Singapore will not be what it is today. More importantly, because of you, we are the most educated people due to your great foresight in the investment of its people and brain power.

Thank you, Lee Kuan Yew.

Dear Mr Lee,
Every year National Day, I will look forward to seeing you at the parade as you would make it a point to come rain or shine. You will be greatly missed especially in this year National Day parade as we celebrate the fruit of your labour.


Thank you so much for your sacrificial love for Singapore and all you have done for us. Without your visionary leadership and dedication to Singapore, it will not have progressed so far.

No words can describe our grief and sorrow at your passing. Though we cannot bear the thought that you had finally left us forever, you had done enough for Singapore. You needed a good rest.
May you rest in eternal peace, MM Lee.

You will always be in my thought and heart,
June A
June Ang

Mr Lee,
Your selfless, tireless contributions and sacrifices for us shall stay in Singaporean’s hearts and memories forever. You stood out as the inspirational leader, the guiding voice for us to rally us and bring Singapore through our darkest, turbulent moments. Others would have taken the easy way out, but you took the path unchartered, and single-handledly build Singapore from nothing. And today, we are able to enjoy the fruits of your work and policies which you had labored so hard on for many years. It speaks volume of the borderless foresight that helped to bring us where we are today; a safe, prosperous and vibrant city state. Most importantly, you have given all of us an identity which you had set out to do, a place where we are proud to call Home.


The people shall always be indebted to you. Your legacy will echo on for many generations to come, and future generations will always remember you as the founding father of modern Singapore.
Kok Soon

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
From the Independence in 1965, you’ve put in all your heart, mind and soul into Singapore.


You set up the Infrastructure of Singapore, Maintained and Improved it until what it is today.
It has never been easy for anyone to have done what you did for Singapore, with your Vision, Intelligence and Hard Work.
I am proud to be a Singaporean, to have been born in Singapore, witnessing all the changes, through the times where Singapore transformed into a First World Country through your Hard Work, Passion, Commitment and Effort that you’ve put in to make Singapore became what it is today.

All your ideals, speeches, thoughts, histories will be always remembered, deep down into our hearts.

“”If you, who are growing up, do not understand that you have to defend this, then in the end, we will lose. Other people will come, smack you down and take over.””
– Lee Kuan Yew in 1967.

This quote has always been in my mind, I have always agreed that, if we don’t defend our country, who will?

Mr Lee,
Thank you for everything, it has been a long road for you, putting every single effort, mind and strength for Singapore.
There are no words to describe my gratitude for everything you have done for all of us and for Singapore.

Have a good rest, farewell and rest in peace.
Damien Tan Chin Wee

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
The only time I ever saw you in real life, was when the school choir I was in was invited to sing the National Anthem at the Tanjong Pagar CC, to celebrate Singapore’s 42nd birthday. You were seated at the table right in front of us and I remember being so thrilled to be able to sing for you, the Founding Father of Singapore.


You were always more of a textbook figure to many of the youths in my generation. Sadly, we were not able to experience the years when you rallied the older Singaporeans together to build this beautiful nation that we are all proud to call home now.

Admittedly, the first time I’ve heard your speeches were when our local channels started to air them after your passing, but after every single speech I’ve watched, I was in awe. Your passion for Singapore was evident, your desire to build an independent Singapore was strong and you were ever so humorous in your own way.

People say that you ruled Singapore with an iron fist and that too many restrictions have been placed. Yet, I feel you were just doing the job of what a typical Asian parent does. It’s like how our parents placed restrictions on us when we were younger, you probably felt it was necessary to establish these rules during our developing years. Thanks to that, we are now one of the safest and cleanest countries to live in the world.

Over the past week, 1 in 10 Singaporeans have queued for 4-11 hours just to catch a glimpse of you, me included. The wait was tiring but nothing could ever compare to the effort and dedication you put into serving this nation.

Thank you and rest in peace, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. You will definitely be missed by all of us.
Tay”

For 50 years you have been working tirelessly to build for us not only a good education, job and a roof but the most clean, safe and beautiful vibrant garden city that many people from other country envy us and would wish to live here too.


All the world know Singapore all because you have made the five star in our country flag shining bright like a diamond round the globe. You have make Singapore from a small red dot in the world map to become a world class country recognize by all.

You have dedicated your entire life to ensure every Singaporean has the best in every aspect including a foundation that will last for many years to come. We appreciate everything you have built for us and its ours now and many more new generation responsible to safe guard Singapore.

With many top official from over the world pouring in here to send you off, its further endorse your position in this globe and making all Singaporean proud. We wish we could have you around for another 50 years as we will miss your sharp vision, convincing speech, at time candid, your laughter and many more memory you have left behind. Father Lee Kuan Yew, We are lucky to have you and without you we may not have what is Singapore today, We thank you for all your determination and unselfishness to dedicate all your life for us and you will be forever remember.
Alson Ng

Thank you Mr. Lee for your many years of dedication and perseverance to change Singapore from a third world country to a first world country. You have blessed us with a beautiful, flourishing and stable green city with your many years of labour and vision. Without you, there would be no Singapore and we should never take things for granted.


Fifty years ago, you have cried for the nation and fifty years later, the nation is crying for you. It warmed my heart so much to see many people queuing many hours with no complaints just to pay our last respect to you. This clearly displays our nation united as one! One people, one nation, one Singapore!

Though I am not born in the era whereby I am able to experience the radical changes. I would say, I am extremely bless to be born during the time whereby Singapore has developed so much. Having watched the programmes on TV about you, your contributions, passion for the people have etched in my memory. I will always remember the values you have taught us to my next generation.

I brought my young son whom is four years old to pay our last respect to you. He may not have understood why but I am sure when he grows up, he will be able to relate.

I am still saddened by the fact of your departure, however, the greatest consolation is that, both Mrs. Lee and yourself are finally united.

May you go in peace, Mr. Lee.
Wong Yoon Mei

Dear Mr. Lee Kuan Yew,
On 23rd March 2015, I woke up from sleep at about 0600 hrs in despair when I read the news of your passing at 0318 hrs from the screen of my mobile phone. I disbelief that our founding father has passed away.


Mr. Lee, your contribution for Singapore & all Singaporean are beyond doubts. You have sacrifices your entire life over 6 decade for every single one of us as a Singaporean. We, as the citizens of Singapore, owe you huge debts and probably unable to pay back in our entire life.

I am very sure the new generation leaders of Singapore will continue your great legacy ensuring Singapore future prosperity. Singaporean will definitely continue to work hard and strive for a better future with the new leaders.

My family & I, thank you for bringing us whatever we have in Singapore today.

May you rest in peace & blessed all Singaporean always.
Lim Teck Keong
28th March 2015

Dear Founding Father Lee Kuan Yew,
I am sorry for being ignorant about you and taking things around me for granted for the past 30 years of my life. Your passing really wakes me up and makes me having a different view in life. I have always thinking of migrating but I’m having a second thought now. Seeing my daughter having a better life than mine is a proven result from your great leadership. I hope that I will have the chance to contribute to Singapore as I’m a Singaporean. No matter what you’ve done, right or wrong policy, I know you did it for our good. Seeing you off during the state funeral procession under the heavy rain is nothing compared to the dedication you have for us during your lifetime. You will be greatly missed and will be an inspiration to me. Thank you once again for everything that you’ve done for us. May your soul rest in peace.

There have been leaders who fought and freed their nations from the colonial yoke, there have been leaders who led their fledgling nations on the path of peace and development, there have been leaders who united teeming millions into a nation, there have been leaders who reside in the hearts of millions, there have been stalwarts who served the poor and unfortunate, there have been stalwarts who fought to eradicate social evils.


Yet, there has been and most probably will ever be one person who achieved all this and more. A man who dared to fight the imperialists, a man who dared to fight divisive forces, a man who fought back shattered dreams of a lifetime to fight back and forge a nation where none existed. A man who turned adversity into opportunity. A man who dared to take strong decisions in the interests of his country and countrymen. A man who delivered and in style.

A visionary who thought of plans which are strategic and management jargons today. Environment sustainability, core competence, efficiency, productivity, clean and efficient governance, on time delivery, courteous public service. You name it and all these were thought,planned and implemented in the 60s by this visionary. A strategist, a far sighted visionary, steadfast, determined, resolute, a real leader.

Yes, the world may never see another one like you. Our humble salute and a heartfelt thanks for everything you did. May your vision live and may the nation continue to prosper as you envisioned for ever.
Nikhil Namboodiri

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
Thank you for being the driving force of Singapore. Without you, I imagined that Singapore would be a very different country.


Singapore would not have been the great nation it is today if it you did not believe in us. You persevered and spearheaded a small fishing village into a cosmopolitan city. It was, no doubt, a difficult feat. After all, Singapore was just a small country in Asia. We had no natural resources and land was limited. But you had a vision and you saw to the end of it.

Gaining independence, you laid out plans to ensure a good future for your countrymen. You implemented them efficiently and effectively. The truth was that you loved Singapore. Simply, profoundly, and utterly.

Your character and integrity were the most important part of you. You believed that only a man with great morals and values can rule Singapore. You were, perhaps, the best person for the job. I think that everyone ought to emulate you; to be a person of principle and do what is right instead of what is popular.

As Singapore grieve your death, we also celebrate your life’s achievements. You left behind a powerful legacy that will be remembered by each and every Singaporean.

Thank you very much indeed for being the architect of Singapore.
A genuinely grateful citizen of Singapore, Desiree

Dear Mr. Lee, our great Founding Father,


THANK YOU, from the bottom of my heart. No amount of words can express my deep gratitude for all that you have done.

I have always grown up proud as a Singaporean. When I was young, I didn’t know why. I just knew I felt proud when I was watching National Day parades, and the crowd cheered when you arrived at the stadium. When I grew up and began to understand more about my country, I begin to understand. Singapore had humble beginnings. We all worked hard, and we thrived under your leadership, your guidance, your determination and many more that I probably can’t name it all. Most of all, I think it’s because of the love you had for our nation and it’s people, that we can now be living in a prosperous, safe and comfortable country, that many others admired.

This week, I found myself sharing with my 3 young children a lot more about Singapore’s history and you and your party’s contributions, and as they found me weeping everyday over the loss of Singapore’s founding father, they began to understand why they are so fortunate to be born and living in Singapore.

What we can do now is to carry on the legacy you left behind, continue to work hard and thrive, ensure Singapore progresses in the international arena, and bring our children up well so they too can continue the legacy, and ensure Singapore continues to shine.

My family and I never fail to watch the National Day parade. This year, we will miss you dearly, and we forever will. But that doesn’t stop us from watching it year on year, as it’s also a time when we reflect and appreciate all that we have. And all that you have done for us.

Thank you, for giving us this beautiful nation. We will continue your work for Singapore.
With lots of love, Eileen Nah and family

Dearest Mr Lee
“”Merdeka!”” a word which you often used back in the early years of Singapore. The word that probably kept you motivated throughout the darkest moments of your life but yet got you through it. Risking your life and battling against all odds, you pulled through with your perseverance and determination for our independence. You strived hard for us to build this wonderful nation that i was born into while leading an example of how a great leader and father should be. But most importantly, you reminded me the word ‘independent’. How it takes to be an independent person..


I can’t thank you enough for what you have done. Your contributions and legacy will always be remembered by each and every Singaporeans as well as the future generations. You will always be remembered and rest assured we will live by the fundamentals that you have set for us and together as a properous nation, we build a better future.

One people, one nation, one Singapore!
Love, Flo

Dear Mr Lee,


From third world country with no natural resources to the current prosperous, safe, stable environment that we have today comes by no means an easy feat. But you did it. You believed that in your team, your fellow men and all our forefathers that “”10 years from now, it (Singapore) will be a metropolis – never fear!””

And you said, “”Whoever governs Singapore must have that iron in him. Or give it up. This is not a game of cards. This is your life and mine.””

Thank you for your never ending contribution through your foresight, leadership and grit to what Singapore is today. When I heard of your unwavering love story and then more of your personal life, I was touched. We are fortunate to have everything we have today and are proud to be Singaporeans. Gratitude and appreciation fills us.

You will be deeply missed and will live in all our heart. May you be reunited with your beloved wife and rest in peace.

Thank you ah gong.

Majulah Singapura!

Dear Lee Kuan Yew
I have only met you once. It was on the occassion of tree planting day at my ward BV. Though already feeble in your sagely years, you have nevertheless made it a point to attend the event. I joined throngs of residents in anticipation as we watched you water the new tree. I held much awe of you. I lived much of my childhood under your administration. In that period, I saw then a already modern city metamorphosise into a global metrapolis.


As we approach the final hours of your wake at Parliament house, we continue to mourn the passing of a titan and our northstar. For many of us, this is not only national loss, it is also a personal one. Many
of us stood vigil as we wait for our turn to pay our last respects. In this moment, words become poor instruments in conveying our thoughts. And if we were relive the moments of the 1968 rainy national day, I believe none of us would have move an inch as we await our turn in the queue to stand next to you one last time. No rain, thunder or lightning would have turned us away. Just as in 1968, we would have stayed united.

Even as we mourn, we will also remember to celebrate your life. You have lived your time creating and fulfiling an impossible dream in making this island state our safe home.You have united us as one people in nation building. And we stay united. Your legacies will find its place in the history of nations, and your name will be a legend in our aspirations.

You have lifted this little red dot onto the global map. You have made our 5 stars shine so bright they become the envy and model of nations. You have given us PRIDE. And you do this relentlessly, making it your life mission in pursuing everything possible for the betterment of S’pore and S’poreans.You had expected nothing less for the country and gave your whole life to do this. You do this because for the people, you CARE.

My generation and generations yet to come will remember you. In each of us, a bit of Lee Kuan Yew lives within. We can get to where want to go because of the roads you built earlier. And in doing so, we will continue to build new pathways for future generations. We know you will foreover be watching us.

May you rest in peace.
Goh Wee Hong

It has been a surrealistic feeling for the past five days since you are gone; is it real? How can it be real? It feels that you are still around.


Reality hits home for tomorrow is the day. The preparation of your funeral, the details, the dignitaries; people united to respect you, the world mourns your passing….

So, founding father of the Republic of Singapore Mr Lee, indeed you are no longer with us.

May your spirit lingers forever to watch over us and our leaders.

You have unselfishly given your life to this country till the end. May you now go to another place where you can live a life all for yourself and yourself only. You have said, “”I have no worries, I have done my job””. Indeed your mission is accomplished.

Farewell Mr Lee, good bye.
S. Ngo

Our Wee Family is deeply saddened and grieved with the passing of our Singapore Founding Father – Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Since he was admitted to hospital due to pneumonia, the family had been praying that he would recover well and join the nation in the SG50 jubilee celebration. If only Mr Lee was allowed a few more good months… but nobody defies destiny.


Nevertheless, Mr Lee’s spirit will survive in eternity, in all our hearts and in all our memories, in all aspects and faucets of Singapore, in the history of Singapore and the world as a visionary leader who passionately loves the country, believes in its cause and charts strategies to architect and develop it from a slump to a modern-day first-class nation.

It has been Singapore’s fortune to have Mr Lee. It has been the PAP and the cabinet’s fortune to have Mr Lee as its leader, mentor or coach as there has been so much that Mr Lee has shared and taught. We really hope that the legacy and foundation that Mr Lee has painstakingly left behind, will be the impetus to touch the real passion and hearts of the new generation Singapore leaders to lead with the same type of self-sacrificing heart and brains like Mr Lee had been doing for Singapore and his people, even till the day he was down.

Mr Lee, your destiny with Singapore, with the people and with us, are always bounded as ONE. We fondly bid you goodbye and we hope you be united in happiness with the late Mrs Lee and we hope that your future destiny be of direct relevance to Singapore (if you believe in reincarnation).
Wee Family – Richard, Joyce and Angela

Dear Mr Lee,
I regret that it is only at your passing that I, like many Singaporeans, have a chance to reflect and pay tribute for your contributions to Singapore and more importantly to your citizens in a single minded, emotional yet wholly grateful manner.


I am grateful to have grown up in a Singapore carefully moulded by you and enjoy the fruits of your labour you had toiled so patiently and diligently for us. You have not only put this small and otherwise insignificant country in the map, but also created in your lifetime the ‘Uniquely Singapore Singaporeans’. We may not be conscious but I believe that we all carry a bit of you in our personality as we live by your ethos of hardwork, efficiency (time waits for no one) and tenacity. I am proud of it and thank you for not just the life I lead today (and the future) but also the values you have instilled in me. I only hope to continue to do you proud, as with the rest of Singapore, and my children and the generations to follow, in doing the same.

Your contributions and dedication to this country and your people is irreplaceable and will forever go into the history books as not just the founder of modern Singapore but also our stern yet nurturing Father, always pushing us to be strong and independent but only with our best interest at heart by pushing your children to come together to build a successful and prosperous Singapore. Thank you again and we will miss you.

Christine Chia and family

You have been the most extraordinary and unique world leader and role model. You made Singapore shine on the international level, transforming a little red dot from third world to more than a first world country and number one in many areas that many envy. I always tell my foreign friends and colleague i am not just a chinese, i always insist that i am known as a Singaporean !


We are able to stand proud as Singaporeans, live comfortably in a peaceful and safe country because of your love and dedication, your strength, your leadership, your great vision, an efficient and clean government. I am grateful to be able to experience the transformation (over the 37 years, born, grew up and worked in Singapore) that you have done and eternally thankful to you. My father moved to Singapore from China during the WWII, often tell me stories of the old days. Because of you, i had a good education, bilingual, had a good job, able to improve my family’s life and bought my own HDB flat.

You have touched not just the lives of Singaporeans but also many people around the world. A loving and devoted husband, a strict father, a disciplined man, a passionate man with a strong belief. We will not be able to find such an inspiring person like you. You spent your whole lifetime building this country, you have made sure that your legacy will last for a long time to come. Nothing is by chance.

Thank you Mr Lee. Singapore will forever owes you a debt of eternal gratitude. You made this possible for us ! I am deeply sadden at your departure but happy you will be once again be reunited with Mrs. Lee. You will be deeply missed and dearly cherished in our hearts for forever !
May you rest in peace !

缅怀国父李光耀先生。
黄秀珍 鞠躬

Dear Mr Lee,
I am a member of the younger generation of Singaporeans. Having been born within the last twenty or so years, my peers and I may never truly understand the depths of hardship which our forefathers faced in the past. For us, it can occasionally be difficult to reconcile the imagery of poverty and squalor, violence and rioting and undeveloped swampland with the developed, efficient, clean and comfortable Singapore which we live in today. This is the monumental impact which you have had on my grandparents and parents.

But your work, your life, has undoubtedly been a blessing to my generation as well.

Because you insisted on meritocracy, I and my peers – from all walks of life, from every racial group and from every social background imaginable – were able to learn and enrich ourselves in the Singapore education system, and now have the opportunity to further our studies across a wide variety of fields – from medicine to music; law to architecture; economics to engineering.

Because you stood up against corruption, I as a future doctor can trust that the government’s health policies will be developed for the good of the people and that I will be empowered to help my future patients no matter their social circumstances.

Because you strived to create a clean and green Singapore, I am able to commute from home to university in comfort, to breathe without being driven to bouts of coughing, something which cannot be said about many other great cities of the world such as New York or Beijing.

Mr Lee, because of your unwavering resolve to do right by your people, my generation is one which has a bright future ahead of us. Because of all that you have done for your country, my peers and I have the precious chance to strive for achievement, to enrich our lives and to grasp opportunities that are made available only because we live and were brought up in the Singapore which you have created.

Thank you for all that you have done for Singaporeans young and old, and may we strive to maintain a Singapore that is befitting of your legacy.

May you rest in peace.
Daryl

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
Tomorrow, the whole nation will pay our last respect and goodbye to you. It saddens us greatly that Singapore has lost the greatest leader a nation could have.


Sir, you have dedicated your entire life to building Singapore. You had a foresight that no others have. You are a remarkable man and led your team to ensuring that we, the younger generations would survive and prosper. We survived and Singapore has progressed in such a fast pace that even other developed countries are amazed by our achievements.

‘Merdeka!’ You uttered with such gusto and fervour. And indeed we are ‘merdeka’. It would not have been possible without your sacrifice. We will forever be indebted to you, Sir.

Dear Sir, we will move on but your spirit and memories will live with us. Farewell and Rest in Peace. We will miss you.

To PM Lee and family, our deepest condolences.
Sincerely, Hamidah & Family

Dear Mr. Lee Kuan Yew,
I have never thought of writing to you Sir, but i’ve decided to pen down this tribute for not only of my accord and also on the behalf of my late father.
You were the inspiration to both of us, your selflessness & sacrifices for our people and country go beyond words can describe.


Thank you for the safe and prosperous country you’ve developed this small island from a mud swamp to the metropolitan city we are now.

When I learnt of the demise of you, I felt like I’ve lost my father again, which a part of me died when my dad died. I’m sure many Singaporeans like myself felt the loss of our founding father when you left us, and we’ll always remember you in our hearts and mind.

Your reputation resonates beyond Singapore which is not a surprise to all of us since many people around the world is as saddened as we are and the legacy you leave behind will forever remains in all Singaporeans.

Your passion for SIngapore sits at a testament of all the accomplishments you’ve achieved in building this great nation of ours. I can’t imagine Singapore without you Sir, will we still be a 3rd world country or even a mud swamp?

I am proud to be a Singaporean simply because of this great nation you’ve built from your blood, sweat and sacrifices.

May you rest in eternal peace our great founding father!
Respectfully, Dean.

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
Thank you for sacrificing your life to build Singapore into a Garden City. Without you, there will be no Singapore and no humans like us and Singapore will not be where it is today. Thank you for providing us with a good education. I will be taking my PSLE this year and your passing has certainly created a big impact on me especially in education aspect. Even though you are no longer around, all of us will surely remember all the sacrifices you have made. Singapore is very fortunate to have you as our leader. You are indeed a visionary leader with big dreams and passion and have dedicated your entire life to build this nation. A million thank you for all your life-time hard works and contributions!!!


May You Rest in Peace Mr Lee Kuan Yew. You will always be fondly remembered…
With Love, Isabelle Lim (Class 6J) Maha Bodhi School ”

Dear Mr Lee,
I cannot thank you enough for creating such a beautiful and safe country for me to grow up and now in turn for my daughter to grow up in. This is not to be take granted for. I learnt from my years of travel that it can be considered a luxury for a woman to be able to walk alone on the streets. Indeed The Merdeka you sought & fought for gave me the freedom to walk freely on homeland. Thank you so much for creating this safe & equal country for me to grow and for me to bring up my daughter in. I know my gal will stand equal chances for all opportunities!


The vision you carved out will carry through for many generations to come.
Many of your teachings will always stay in my heart. Towards excellence we will continue to strive. Thank you for giving your life to build our country and improving the lives of Singaporeans. It is never in vain but well worth it.

You will always live in our hearts!

Thank you & goodbye Sir!
Kris, Chan Yan Yi Mother of Kaelyn Teng

Thank you Mr Lee for all your contributions. As a teenager who has grown up in Singapore, it is true that I haven’t been living long enough to have witness the changes and contributions to this lovely country. However, it is this very fact that stands witness to your work and endless efforts; because of the policies you have implemented we are able to enjoy all the amenities the incredibly high standard of living, because of your work we only know Singapore for who she is today, a far cry from the third world country.


As women struggle for equality and basic human rights like education in other countries, I am so blessed to have been born in Singapore whereby education is funded and supported, wholly due to your vision in equipping Singaporeans with knowledge to become skilled, literate and hence competitive. It has done so much to raise generations of thinkers who will continue to drive growth in Singapore. Other amenities like healthcare, a clean and green Singapore and a strong defence force were birthed from your extraordinary vision. Hence, we are so thankful for your contributions, we are so humbled that you have sacrificed your life into building this wonderful home and we are determined to continue your legacy and strive for further success in Singapore.

It has been a long journey and whatever detractors may say, they will never be able to take away the glory that us Singaporeans will endlessly heap upon you, for we all bear witness to the lifetime of achievements you have made for us, with us.

Rest in peace Mr Lee, our founding father, your legacy will continue forever.
Nicolette Koh

You have spent half a century of your life building up this nation. From a tiny island without any natural resources to a first class country that shines out in the world. Your foresight, dedication and great leadership has brought us to where we are today – a beautiful home that is safely secured, cohesively bond together, great education system and a world class business hub. In life, you have inspired us and you deserved our utmost respect and admiration.


I would like to thank you for your great work to lead your team that brought Singapore to what it is today. I am grateful for the law and order, job opportunities, education avenues, clean and green environment, modern infrastructures, convenient transportation system, fresh drinking water and other things that make the life of Singaporean better in many ways. Really grateful that Singapore had a leader like you.
May You Rest in peace. Yours Sincerely, Kaiming & Hui Ping

Dearest Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
Because of you, I am proud to be born a Singaporean.


No words are enough to thank you for everything you have done for Singapore. I am one of the silent majority who have deep respect towards you for your enormous contributions for this country. But today, I have chosen not to be silent.

As a kid, I didn’t know what nation building was about until I saw you delivering your messages during National Day Celebrations and your extremely strong determination to make us a First World City.

Because of you, I grew up with exceptional education, beautiful housing, and world-class healthcare. Because of you, I roam freely in a city with clean air, safe drinking water and low crime rates. Because of you, I had the opportunity to travel around the world, be it for work or leisure, and hold my Red Singapore Passport with a strong sense of pride and dignity.

And because of you, we are now a First World City.

Growing up, I remembered vividly when one of my teachers taught us that you were never ever afraid to take up unpopular policies for Singapore so long as you believed it is for the long-term good of the country. I am indeed blessed to have reaped the benefits of your vision and courage to proceed in what you want for the greater good of Singaporeans.

This week, I cannot help but cry when news of your passing on were confirmed. Though I have never seen you in person, somehow you felt like a close family member to me. Paying you final respects in person at the Parliament House was the very least I can do for you.

Thank you, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Thank you for the tears that you have shed for Singapore. Thank you for putting your heart and soul into Singapore’s growth and future.

And most importantly, thank you for the fatherly love you have shown for Singapore and its people.
With love and respect,
Fang Jee

To our Founding Father, Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
Words cannot express my gratitude as I, along with the entire nation bid our final farewells to you. Under your leadership, Singapore has transformed from a third world country to a first world, modern metropolis in such a short period of time.


Your vision, dedication, sacrifice and lifetime of hard work led to the Singapore today. As a young Singaporean, I have been extremely privileged to be able to watch you lead us from the front over the years. I have been given the same opportunities regardless of my race, religion or beliefs. You have built us a safe, peaceful and beautiful country we all proudly call home.

Rest assure that we will take good care of Singapore and make sure it grows from strength to strength. It is the least we can do to honor your memory and legacy. Your tremendous contributions to Singapore and the world will forever be remembered to future generations of Singapore.

Thank you Mr Lee Kuan Yew for everything. Without you, there won’t be Singapore. I will forever be indebted to you. Rest in Eternal Peace Sir.
A Grateful & Proud Singaporean Son, Leonard Leo

Thank you Mr Lee.
I am proud to be Singaporean because of what you have done.


Thank you for your unwavering devotion, sacrifice and passion towards this country. From an island with almost nothing and many living in poverty, we are a prosperous and peaceful nation today because of you.

I can walk alone at night and have no fear. I never had to go hungry and I have a solid roof over my head. I required extensive medical care from a young age, and my family would never have afforded it if not for the healthcare scheme put in place. I had the opportunity to go to school and that enabled me to hold on to a decent job today. We live in harmony and I am proud that we are one of the least corrupt nations in the world. I am a beneficiary of your tireless passion and devotion to Singapore.

Thank you and thank you again. I can never say enough.

My closest personal encounter with Mr Lee was about 8 years ago when I had to accompany a foreign visitor to the Istana for a dinner function. Our driver drove us past the Istana gates, and then we stopped mid-way. I looked out and saw the back views of Mr Lee and his wife holding hands and taking a stroll. It was such a sweet moment, and it struck me that, despite Mr Lee’s seemingly tough public persona, there was this soft side to him and he was very in love with his wife.

Even as many mourn at the passing of our great founding father, I like to think that perhaps at the other side, you are reunited with your wife and you are happy. Wherever you may be, you will always be fondly remembered and missed greatly by the millions whose lives you have changed for the better.

May we and our future generations never forget what you have done, and continue to build on the Singapore you have created – a peaceful, just, forward-thinking, united and successful nation – that Singapore will always be a lasting legacy to your great works.

Thank you Mr Lee.
Stella Chan

Dearest Mr Lee,
I have always regarded you as a great man and know that you played a crucial role in building the home I have today. But honestly, it is only through the many things I have read and heard over the past few days that made me realize how I have taken so many things for granted.


Thank you for being so strong and persevering in doing what you felt was right for us when our country was so young and vulnerable. It is never easy to go against the flow and I’m almost certain that there were many moments you were criticized, rebuked for your actions. But thank you for believing in us and for not giving up on us. You continued to care for us despite all the difficulties even when letting go seemed to be an easier option. Honestly, I don’t know how you found all the strength you did. You probably didn’t know or expect the number of hearts you have touched until the past week because it probably wouldn’t matter and you would care for us anyway.

Thank you for allowing us to grow and learn in such a safe environment and for giving us the freedom to believe and practise our faith openly. Servant leadership is truly what you practised, leading the nation by serving and placing the needs of all above your own. As a compassionate man, you have showed us how to love and reminded us how we should love the people around us wholeheartedly through all your ‘random acts of kindness’ that perhaps were of second nature to you.

Thank you for all that you have done. For giving us your life. For sharing and teaching us to love and how to love. No doubt, there will never be another person like you.
Celeste

I never realised how good I had it in Singapore until I went overseas to study.

As a child of the 80s, I was born during a time of stability and wealth. I grew up generally happy and healthy, unaware of the many battles that were previously fought over and in Singapore so that we could enjoy what we had.

When I went off to study I had a little bit of a culture shock since there was no censorship, less order in general and I always felt like I had to watch out for my own safety a lot more.

As I grew up, I learned a lot more about Mr. Lee than what was in the textbooks. I heard some inspiring things, and some not so nice things and of course wondered if they were true and if they were, whether they were necessary.

Now that I am where I am – an entrepreneur, a mother to 2 small children, a wife to a wonderful man – I am grateful and will always be indebted to Mr. Lee for the things he has done and for the tough choices he had to make.

As an entrepreneur, Mr. Lee has inspired me with his out-of-the-box thinking. He is an excellent mentor not just for world leaders, but also for entrepreneurs and CEOs who want to build crazy successful businesses and become men and women of substance, integrity and vision.

Rest in peace Mr. Lee. You’ve done so much already; Let us carry on in your stead to bring Singapore to even greater heights in the years to come.

A special tribute to Mr Lee Kuan Yew
The founding Father for Singapore


I think everyone not only in Singapore, but the entire region is watching Singapore on this special occassion, a passing of its great leader, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Its a time of thanksgiving and remembering a person whom fight and built Singapore for us. Eventhough I am not a local borned Singaporean, but we are very thankful to him, and his influences us as Malaysian and for me S’pore PR. His deep insight and thougts has brought this land – Singapore to a first class country in this era. His contribution to education and National service is a great impact to us as new generation of Singapore. It is only with high and quality education, produces quality generation and professionals which will brings Singapore to a civilized urban metropolis in Asean and even the global stage of the world.

Mr Lee Kuan Yew has a very deep and brilliant insights even it was many years back to built Singapore differently into a Green and clean garden city. With all these little things, it brings great influences and impact on the country’s economy and opens the doors to multinational trading. Not only that, the houses we stay, the gardens we have, the shelter we walk under the rain and sun, the buses and transportation we have, the fresh air and clean water for us to use, all and all, were fight for and given to us, so we need to be very thankful.

On the other hand, as Malaysian I am very thankful for his great work and open minded to allow us to have a chance to change our life, to be educated, to be able to secure a job and to have a chance to get the Permanent Residentialship in Singapore. All these doesnt comes so easily without him. Without him, we might we suffer together as what most Malaysian are suffering now. If he did not fight for independent of Singapore and think thoroughly and ingenious ingenious thoughts, there wouldn’t such organized and well managed garden living standard and job opportunites not only for Singaporean but also for the citizens of the neighbouring countries.

Looking back at the National Service and educations in Singapore, he created a syllabus of mindful plants to thrive for a healthy, fit and knowledgeable young men and generation. Man in Singapore are physically fit and building a strong mentality to face the reailty and real world through the National Service. Boys are trainned to be stronger and firm to face difficulties and hardship. All these are the long term plans which introduced by our late Mr Lee, although it is a non-popular policy to the nation, but without that we won’t be like this healthy and strong today. On the other hand, his view on the importance of education allows us to be able to be educated even we have financial difficulties or students from other nationality, are given a chance to be educated. Its a tremendous plan and has long term impact on Singapore and those who came to study in Singapore. For me and those whom are given a chance to study in Singapore, we are very thankful to Mr Lee, it is very hard to imagine how are we today if we are not given this chance to enter into Singapore.

There are lots more to talk about when it comes to his hardwork and contribution to not only Singapore, but to the Chinese in Malaysia, and the world. Looking at our region and countries around us, if there is no Singapore, no one will know Malaysia, no one will know us, but because of Mr Lee, we are well-known to the world.

Today, we are his grandsons and granddaughters, here in Singapore and Malaysia enjoys the fruit of his hard work and we are thankful to him. Today also he will meet St John Paul II in heaven enjoy the gift from God for his great work and contribution! Mr Lee Kuan Yew, we love you! and you will be remembered.
Yours faithfully,
Luke Lee.

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
Shakespeare once said, “”Some are born great, some achieve greatness, some have greatness thrust upon them””. Without a doubt, Mr Lee, you were born great, and went on to achieve greatness! You showed the world what a little red dot like us can and has achieved under your great leadership. You were an ingenious visionary!


As residents in the Tanjong Pagar constituency for 3 generations, we had the privilege of having you as our MP. No words can describe our gratitude to you for all the things you have done for us, and for Singapore. A very big THANK YOU to you from the bottom of our hearts.

Time has come for us to bid you farewell. We will always remember you. Rest in peace, Mr Lee, Singapore is in good hands.

PS. Our deepest condolences to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his family on the demise of Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
God bless,

Forever and always, I will always be grateful to Mr Lee Kuan Yew for what he has done for Singapore. It is not easy to have given up his life for Singapore but yet, that was what he did. He gave his all to build up Singapore to where she is today. I am thankful to be a Singaporean, to be living in a clean and green state, to have a shelter over my head, to experience quality education and to have all our basic needs met and more.


In a short span of 50 years, he has achieved so much for Singapore. Singapore is nowhere near how it was 50 years ago. It has grown exponentially into the first world country we are all privileged to live in today. This, I attribute it to Mr Lee, who had the foresight and more importantly, the strong determination to develop Singapore. He never gave up despite the odds. He could have but he did not and all his life, he gave his all to Singapore. It is also inspiring how he never gave up learning even when times were bad and uncertain. He is an amazing and inspirational man and no amount of words can express the gratitude I have for Mr Lee, our founding father. There are times when I wished I had the opportunity to say a simple ‘thank you’ to him when he was living.

The love story between Mr and Mrs Lee has also touched my heart greatly. Their love for one another is like none other. Photos of their younger days actually placed a smile on my face for I am glad that they had each other in their lives. But tears sprung to my eyes when I read about how Mr Lee was dealing with the passing of Mrs Lee. It was an unimaginable period for Mr Lee then. I sincerely hope that they are finally reunited now.

Mr Lee Kuan Yew, you have made an impact in the lives of so many people. Though you are no longer here with us, one thing is for sure, you will never be forgotten. I will always remember you and continue to share your stories with future generations to come. We are here because of you, because you held on and never gave up.

Thank you, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. May you rest in peace now.
Adwyna

Dear Sir
I write this message with a heavy heart mixed with a satisfaction that you have lived a full life.


The world will not see another leader as strong & powerful as you. What you have left behind for us is uncountable. A Corruption free nation, a red passport that requires minimum visas across the world, a country that is safe for a girl to be out at 2am, a very clean & green nation, roof over our heads, ensuring the needies are taken care, etc. the list can go on….. All these are not possible without your guidance & excellent leaders.

We will not despair but will celebrate your legacy. Your leadership will be carried on by your ministers. You are a Good Samaritan & we will be your shadow in this Nation.

I stand proud to be a Singaporean & that is because of you & your sacrifices. We will miss you but you will live in our hearts forever. We will speck your legacy live with the coming generations. It’s now time for you to rest MR. Lee, the giant of the little red dot. You will always be our guardian angel.
Kohila Subramanian

To the family of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
My deepest condolences to the family.


I really Thank God that I am born in Singapore. Thank God that Mr Lee had given his all for Singapore. Without him, Singapore wont be where she is now. We are just a small dot yet we are influential and being recognized internationally for our progression.

I want to thank Mr Lee for building up a clean and green Singapore. Every 20 steps we take there will be trees shading us from the sun. Singapore is also a safe country, I know I am safe even I am out late at night. Mr Lee had also focus so much on education, without knowledge we would be forever a 3rd world country.

Thank you Mr Lee, for what you have sacrifice for the people of Singapore. May you rest in peace.

Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s last words to me were: “”Think over it carefully, then you ask me the question the next time we meet.”” (ST, 6 Sep 2011)


But it was not to be. That student forum at NTU marked his last appearance on such a platform.

I will always cherish the little conversation we had. Even though it was somewhat confined within the formalities of a dialogue session, I could feel a personal touch when Mr Lee responded to my question on policies for a more equitable Singapore.

His smile. His chuckle. And gentle jab at the end. Like a stern grandpa.

I have never agreed with his views on welfarism or integration of Malay/Muslims in Singapore. But such differences should not stand in the way of recognising Mr Lee’s undoubtedly special place in the history of our nationhood.

My condolences to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Mdm Ho Ching and the Lee family at this difficult time.
Muhammad Farouq Osman

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
Thank you for all that you have done and accomplished, together with your team, which has resulted in the Singapore that we have all come to love and enjoy.


Nothing brings me pride whenever I have the opportunity to return to Singapore from an overseas trip, and the words “”Welcome Home”” appear at the immigration counter back.

The clean, efficient and safe place that we know as Singapore, which is our home, where we have our roots, family, friends and everything else that we hold dear is a place where the foundations were laid strong.

Without this strong foundation, we would not have the opportunity that we all have today, to build on what has been accomplished. We are also equipped with the necessary skills, together with the wisdom and direction from our past experiences, now able to achieve more for the future of our country.

Thank you for all that you have done, for all your thoughts and decisions which always had the best for all of us in mind.

Rest in peace, Sir, and may you watch over us as we forge the path ahead into the future.

To our founding father, Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


I am deeply grateful for your undying love and dedication to us your children, Singaporeans.

You have given us shelter, education, jobs, security and to be able to have an equal footing in society. To date,no one in my opinion, as done so much for a country, that he had to give up his entire lifetime just to shape a third world fishing village to a world class country.

On your passing, I am reminded of our NDP song truly, which reminisces on your sacrifice for us. This verse of the song reminds me of the struggles and tribulations of your strength.

“”When there are troubles to go through
We’ll find a way to start anew
There is comfort in the knowledge
That home’s about its people too
So we’ll build our dreams together
Just like we’ve done before
Just like the river which brings us life
There’ll always be Singapore””

As sadness overcome us upon your passing I pray that you will rest in peace, do know that we are in good hands. We will keep you alive in our memories.

Thank you for everything, no words can gratify for what you have done. I will continue to teach my children of your legacy.
Sharon Shanti

Dear Mr Lee,
Your conviction and commitment to our nation inspires us to do more for our homeland. Your work speaks louder than our encouragement to those who wish to throw in the towel. You made many people think, “”How can I give us so easily?””, “”How can I better serve Singapore?”” and “”How can we be better Singaporeans?””


Your leadership brought us from nothing to what we have today; from being a rural country with almost no hinterland to a thriving metropolis; from being threatened to having deterrence and letting people know that it will hurt to hit us; from diverse communities to a gelled and orderly community who can proudly call ourselves Singaporeans than by our racial makeup.

Those who refute this are in denial.

Many people, young and old, have learnt or are reminded about things we have taken for granted throughout this week. It is a wake up call to many. Thank you, Sir, for still serving Singapore even after you leave us.

Your demise is our loss. But rest assured that the foundation that you and your team has laid will not be in vain – we will make sure that our country will be much better by the time we leave this world, no matter how small.

This is how we will honour what you and our pioneers have done.

My condolences are with your family. Hope they will be able to tide through this tough times.
Yours sincerely,Alaric Leong

Mr Lee Kuan Yew, a man who defied all odds to build a nation we proudly call home today.

I believe words alone are insufficient to truly express the extraordinary feats the man has achieved.

But if one would to just take a glance across the spectacular skyline of Singapore, while reminding himself that this was a third world country not very long ago, he would certainly be struck by the greatness of the man, the man we affectionately address as Father.

This week, the nation and the world mourn the passing of this great man.

Thousands and thousands of people from all walks of life have come together to pay their last respects and express their deepest gratitude towards the man who devoted his whole life to our nation. The endless queue of people outside the Parliament House clearly shows the special, irreplaceable place he has in the hearts of Singaporeans across generations.

As we Singaporeans come together to mourn the loss of our Father, we are truly united as One People, One Nation, One Singapore. As I waited outside the Parliament House, I saw Singaporeans helping one another, volunteers distributing packets of tissue, refreshments and umbrellas. There were also many heart-warming stories shared through social media, and I feel deeply touched by all these little gestures.

I am sure Father would be very pleased.

I hope that this spirit would continue, and we shall stand together stronger and more resolute to continue the legacy of our Father.

“At the end of the day, what have I got? A successful Singapore. What have I given up? My life.”

Thank you, Father.
Kenneth Teoh

Dear Mr Lee,
When I heard about your demise on Monday, tears flowed naturally. The nation has lost its founding father and it is hard to come to terms with it. I watched the the history of how you brought Singapore to independence and to what it is today, I am deeply touched, with admiration for your grit and dedication to this country.


We have learnt much from you, your perseverance and foresight as a country leader; your unwavering love for Mrs Lee as a husband. When Mrs Lee was bedridden, you never failed to read to her each night. When you were hospitalized, you worked tirelessly. Even when you were very sick, you put others above yourself. These are possible because you cared for your people, your loved ones . You have touched the lives of many which can be seen from the endless stream of people coming to say Goodbye to you the last few days. You have inspired and gave hope to the many who think the impossible. Most importantly, you gave us a safe and comfortable place we called home.

Mr Lee, as said, ‘Singapore is your life’s work’ and you know, we Singaporeans can never thank you enough. We will keep your spirit alive and ensure that the generations to come honor your legacy by contributing and making Singapore a better place to live in.

It is time for a well-deserved rest with you loved one, Mr Lee. May you and Mrs Lee be blessed in Heaven.
Alice Goh

Dear Mr Lee,
When the whole world doubted we will survive, waiting for us to fail, you proved to them that Singapore can survive without natural resources, without merging with our neighbour, without colonial power.


You further proved to the world, that Singapore can grow and prosper, and do better than her neighbours that are many times bigger in size, population, and resources.

You united and inspired the people of Singapore to work hard for our survival, to be resilient and undaunted.

You reminded us not to be complacent with our achievements, but to stay ahead of competition.

You were not afraid to implement unpopular policies that will do good to the nation.

You upheld the country’s integrity and dignity by keeping it corruption free and not allowing other countries to tell us how Singapore should be run.

You built a country that is strong and free, that we call Home, that we are proud of.

With Mrs Lee, you have taught us true love and devotion to a long-lasting marriage.

You taught us the core values of upbringing our next generation.

Your lifetime contributions to Singapore are beyond what words can describe. We have so much to learn from each of them.

You have worked hard for your entire life for Singapore and her people.

You can finally rest and be reunited with Mrs Lee.
Thank you for all your teachings, Mr Lee.

You will be dearly missed by the people of Singapore.
Lynn Hwee

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
We are greatly indebted to you for spearheading the transformation of Singapore from the scratch to the current modernised and reputable city in the whole world.


We are gifted to get you as the leader of our young nation. Being the architect of Singapore, you have carefully shaped the country and made it recognised by the whole world. With your visionary instinct, you have worked tirelessly to materialise your visions for the progress of Singapore and for the well being of the people.

We are extremely sad with your parting. Whoever comes to lead our country after your lifetime, no one, absolutely no one can replace you. Nevertheless, the new leaders will definitely follow your footsteps and take Singapore to the next lap.

Your stern leadership with care and concern for the people of Singapore has been admired by all Singaporeans. All the people in Singapore love you deeply. Although you have left us physically, you will always stay in our heart and mind. Thank you very much sir for giving us this wonderful, peaceful, stable and secure life in Singapore.

Sir, please rest in peace.
Tharmilarasan s/o Nagan

I came migrated to Singapore as a 10 year old in 1970, together with my family. I’ve considered myself a Singaporean since and renounced my Malaysian citizenship at the age of 21.


I was a product of a country that offered peace, stability, HDB flat ownership for most families, almost free education for all and jobs for everyone. Yet, in my 20s, with my university education I still was not able to understand the vision, determination and hard work of Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his team to bring us that far. I saw a comfortable if not luxurious life full of possibilities. Therefore, I chaffed at the reins of what I felt was a patriachial PM who wanted to control every little decision its citizens made. I found many of his policies and pronouncements infuriating. Why was he was always talking about survival and how Singapore needed to keep working very hard to survive in those seemingly difficult times?

Reflecting on Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s legacy, I realized I had progressed from 1-room rental flats when I first came to Singapore, to a 4-room flat and after marriage an executive maisonette and finally to a freehold condominium. My family and I have not done too shabbily.

It must have really been tough for Mr Lee to share his vision with people who could not understand him. Yet, he persevered, sticking to what he thought was right for Singaporeans and cajoled, pushed and literally dragged us from Third World to First World status in less than 50 years.

In this past week, it is obvious that everyone has hindsight. But I do not know of anyone with the vision, clarity, tenacity and incorruptibility of Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Yes, he was patriachial but he was like that even with his own family and he loved Singaporeans like he loved his own family and only wanted us to not only survive but prosper on this Little Red Dot.

Thank You Mr Lee Kuan Yew for dedicating your life to building a Singapore we’re proud to call home.
Fang Mei Ling

Thank you Mr. Lee Kuan Yew for all that you’ve done for this country; for all the sacrifices you’ve made. You’ve made it such that I’m proud to call myself Singaporean anywhere I travel to, proud to display my red passport and proud of defend my own country when ill words are spoken.


Your life work has resulted in people around the world being able to distinguish Singapore from the rest of the region. When asked by others where I’m from, I always respond with pride that “”I’m Singaporean”” despite having lived overseas for over a decade. This level of pride is all because of what you’ve done to make what Singapore is today and what Singapore as a country stand for.

We have no doubt lost a great leader, a Titan. But rest in peace knowing that your work will see more Singaporeans stepping up, more leaders being created and more leaders striving to be like you.

Rest in peace Mr. Lee Kuan Yew.
Jessie Goh

from the bottom of my heart…..
My dearest father Lee Kuan Yew, it is so painful to say good-bye to you. You have done so much for us Singaporeans, for whom you have sacrificed your life. If not for you, we will remain as a small dot in the world and nobody would have noticed us. It is because of you that the whole big world is talking about this small dot that is called Singapore. You made the world turned in our direction with admiration. You made every citizen of other countries to yearn for a leader like you. Such is the admiration you get from all around the world. You gave us recognition and respect. Wherever we go in the world we are well received and respected. All these will never be true if not for you. I grew up in a poor family where basic necessities were of questions. But today my kids are living in much comfort. You made education for all compulsory and took away from us all poverty and misery. All these will never be true if not for you. You made opportunities for us to come up in our life and made a difference in each and everyone’s life. I can’t thank you enough Sir Lee Kuan Yew. 50 years ago you cried for Singapore when it was separated from Malaya. Now 50 years later, Singapore is crying for you. How I wish you were immortal but god made you mortal. Now time as come to say good-bye to you. My heart is very painful and my tears doesn’t stop rolling. Good-bye my dear father. You will always be immortal in our memory. Thank you my father for teaching us the great qualities of a great man. God bless your great soul and your family. Love you very much Sir. Rest in peace Mr Lee Kuan Yew!!
Kala Kalaithasan

Dearest Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
In your presence you touched our lives, in your passing you stirred our hearts!


Your accomplishments requires no further elaboration through words because they are facts and truths.

Thousands of miles away from home, knowing what thousands are doing and feeling back home, reading the thousands of words being expressed in The Straits Times everyday, I am afraid a thousand words will not express my thoughts and sentiments now.

But I wish to tell you this. In this week of national mourning, I have become convinced that we do have a Singapore Spirit. It is one that is the personification of you; Disciplined, determined, truthful, hardworking, desire to learn, improve oneself continuously and more.

With this Singapore Spirit, I believe that Singapore will have many good years to come.

So, may you rest in peace.

Yours respectfully,
Lim Kee Hua

Dearest Mr Lee, Founder of Singapore,
No words can describe my sadness on your departure.
You possessed all the traits of a great leader, in fact much more.
It was your undivided and selfless love that make brings this country to what it is today.


For the past few days, I have learnt more about you through the interviews on television programmes and articles I read in the newspapers. You and your team have built and transformed Singapore into a world class nation, well regarded by the world despite we being just a small little red dot in the world map. Singapore’s success will not be possible if not for your hardship, perseverance and toil that you have gone through and overcome during those difficult years.

You are a role model to all and will be dearly missed by all Singaporeans. Please continue to guard and watch over us in wherever you are. May you rest in peace and be reunited with Mrs Lee.
Goodbye Mr Lee, you will always have a place deep down in my heart.
Lee Sheue Yiuh

It is difficult to add to the various tributes already published about this great leader of ours. As a Singaporean PR I have been amazed at what this great leader has achieved for the nation and fellow Singaporeans. I believe Mr. Lee was one among few truly visionary leaders in this world. He was a tough and fair leader driven by a deep personal vision to build Singapore to a world class nation and to provide fellow Singaporeans a life of opportunity comparable with the best in this planet. He achieved both in his lifetime and leaves behind a strong and stable legacy . He will be missed by all of us deeply in this world and I salute him, his sacrifice and dedication, and pray for his soul.
K B Ravindranath Menon

Many Australians share a profound respect for Mr Lee and revere his courage, dignity, profound wisdom and nation-building acumen. We consider him a friend of Australia and many of us wish he was one of our own. Many years ago, he warned us that ‘Australians would become the poor white trash of Asia’ unless economic reform was instituted – a remark which stung Australian politicians to action. To call yourself a ‘mate’ is one thing; however only the very best friend of all will tell you when you are on the wrong path. We say that he was a very great friend indeed.
Debra

To the Singaporean’s beloved Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
Leaders over the world admire and envy us for having such a remarkable founding father. Some even said that Singaporean do not know how to appreciate and feel without gratitude for having such a brilliant leader that have built our nation.

From the day when Mr Lee KY’s passing was announced till the funeral procession’s day, thousands of people were deeply saddened, their sympathy and wanting to pay the last respect attitude during these few days was touching. What can people prove? l believed that every Singaporean knows when and what to respond.

To the majority, Mr Lee KY is not just the first prime minister of Singapore, they even described him as a mighty guardian that sent by God. His journey may have ended on 23 March 2015, but his legacy will lives on. Mr Lee KY is the legend of Singapore.

Thank you Mr Lee, for dedicating your whole life for Singapore that’s we now called home. I’m not a well educated person or a rich entrepreneurs . I am just a ordinary family man. But if there comes to a day where Singapore goes to a war, what I can contribute to our country is to protect her till my dying breath.

One thing for sure ,there are still many Singaporean who are willing and ready to sacrifice for this island city when time has come.

I hope that the government would declare 23 March as a holiday for all future generations Singaporean to remember this great legend of the century.

Farewell Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
Gary Wee

Dear Mr Lee,
Your legacy never dies because to live in the hearts of your people and the first rate nation that you built – is to live forever. Your contributions and personal sacrifices will remain unmatched for decades. We owe an unspeakable debt of gratitude for the epitome of service before self, for your wisd


Rest in peace.
JM

痛失一位这么勇悍，富责任感，具远见和智慧的领导者，心情实是无比哀痛。然而沉溺在深深的哀悼时，别忘了回报他最好的方式是好好地生活，力求种族和谐，社会安定和继续发展。


让我们一起向这位一代巨人深深地鞠躬，因为有他，才有现在的新加坡!

别忘了人家是建立一个家庭，而李先生不只建立一个家庭而且还建立了一个国家! 我们应该把沉痛的心，忆念他的心，转化成力量，竭力把现在的新加坡维持下去或甚至打造得更完美! 我相信这样，李先生他会很高兴的。
安息吧！我们的建国总理李光耀先生。
您会永在怀念中。
Ong Siew Gek

Thank you for making Singapore as what it is today. Without your tremendous effort in helping out with Singapore’s economy, Singapore will not be as advanced and as beautiful. Thank you for sacrificing your entire life just to help Singapore to be a better place for Singaporeans and foreigners to live in. Your ‘Plant a tree campaign’ helped Singapore to be clean and green and Singapore owned the title, “”Garden City””.


Mr Lee Kuan Yew also pursued in Singapore’s education system, to allow every Singaporean child to have the opportunity to be bilingual, therefore, resulting in the Lee Kuan Yew bilingual scholarship.
Thank you for all your wonderful contributions and striving so hard just to make Singapore a better place. Now, all your hard work, tears and sweat have all paid off.
Once again, I would like to say a sincere and grateful thank you to you, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the Founding Father of Singapore. I am very proud to tell others that I am Singaporean and I can call Singapore my home.

饮水思源

Yours sincerely,
Valentina Tan

Dear Mr Lee, a simple thank you is not able to express the gratitude we have for you. Without you, there won’t be a Singapore today. Along side with the pioneer Singaporeans, you have built a safe, clean and fair country for our children. As long, you work hard you will be treated fairly and have a chance to be successful.


When I drive to work yesterday, I saw the flowers along ECP are all blossomed beautifully which is a sight I never seen before. As if it’s saying good bye to the gardener of Singapore, Mr Lee Kuan Yew!

Thank you Sir for everything. May you rest in peace!
Jacky

I’m sorry that I couldn’t make it to the Parliament House to pay my respects personally. Instead, I’ve went to one of the community sites instead. I hope you don’t mind that..


No amount of thank you can suffice the contributions and sacrifices that you’ve made for this nation that I’m proud to call Home. But still, Thank you Sir. You’ve worked so hard for Singapore, thinking about her for every living breath you’ve had. You were selfless, placing Singapore above anything else. You’ve been a great inspiration to many of us, and I’m sure you will continue to be for the future generations.

It has been extremely heartwarming to see Singaporeans queuing to pay their last respects for you, and the kindness from my fellow Singaporeans. And Sir, this is all because of you. Growing up, I’ve always thought of Singaporeans as selfish and un-united. But they’ve proven me so wrong, and I thank you Mr Lee, for uniting us Singaporeans once again.

You’ve done so much and it’s time to take a break. As much as my heart is heavy with sorrow, I’m also glad that you’re free from pain and suffering, and that you’re finally reunited with your love of your life. Thank you too, Mrs Lee, for without you, Mr Lee would be a different person, and Singapore might have not been how she is now. I hope that both of you can continue to watch over us from wherever you are, and know that because of the strong foundation that you’ve given us, we will make Singapore shine even brighter than she is now on the world map.

Thank you and Rest in Peace Sir.
Yijun

Rest in peace esteemed Mr Lee Kuan Yew. i am deeply saddened by your passing. With your passing, it has created a void in Singapore and the hearts of all Singaporeans. But it will be filled with a fond memory of you and all that you have done and fought all your life for Singapore to be what it is today. For that we are eternally grateful. Today as always,I stand proud to be a Singaporean. Anywhere we go we reply with pride that we are from Singapore and with the equal pride when people from all walks of life and country acknowledge with envy what Singapore stand for.


Blessed are we Singaporeans to have had you to guide us and lead us through the times. Even with your passing, your spirit lives on. We will never forget.

In Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s own words: “You begin your journey not knowing where it will take you. You have plans, you have dreams, but every now and again you have to take uncharted roads, face impassable mountains, cross treacherous rivers, be blocked by landslides and earthquakes. That’s the way my life has been.”

“”But we are not an easy-going people. We cannot help thinking, calculating and planning for tomorrow, for next week, for next month, for next year, for the next generation. And it is because we have restless minds, forever probing and testing, seeking new and better solutions to old and new problems, that we have never been, and I trust never shall be, tried and found wanting.’””

With heartfelt gratitude, thank you esteemed Mr. Lee Kuan Yew. Rest in peace.
Toh Jia Song

Dear Mr Lee,
Since the day you left us, I have watched so many videos of your younger days when you did your rally speeches. I have watched how you fought for the independence of Singapore and have admired your conviction and determination in building up a nation. I am deeply touched whenever I witness your devotion for Mrs Lee. You are so much more than I thought I knew about you.


Thank you, Mr Lee. Thank you for your years of hard work and commitment in building this nation. Everything that we are enjoying now, is the fruits of your labor.

I have been thinking these few days on how I can best pay tribute to you, to thank you for all that you have done. I guess the best way that I can possibly do, is to promise you that wherever that I might be in the years to come, I will still come back to Singapore, the nation that makes me proud, the roots of my identity and the home where I belong.

Just yesterday, my friend asked me all of a sudden, whether will I leave Singapore and migrate to another country for retirement. I told her, “”never”” I will not leave behind a nation which is built on tears and sweats by our forefathers. I promise to treasure Singapore and all that has been built for us.

May you rest in peace. You will forever be in my heart and the hearts of our fellow Singaporeans.
Eve

Dear Mr Lee,
I am nine this year. Mummy and Daddy took me to the p.house to see you. But I only see Singapore flag. Mummy told me that is you.


You have built a nation so so pretty. I love all the flowers in the park. Big kisses and thank you

Janet Lim

Dear Mr Lee,
We have not met each other,but you have managed to touch my life in many ways.without Yew,Singapore will not be Singapore today.My life is through the hard works of yours.
Ah gong,thank you for your sacrifice what you have done are for this nation,for the people in Singapore.I am proud to be a Singaporean. You may lay your burden down now. Singapore will miss you with love and admiration.


Miss you forever
MK.Low

I am who I am today, a proud and grateful Singaporean, because of you.
My father was an ardent supporter and my mother a quiet admirer. The rest of us in the family were devotees. Yes, in many ways you were our supreme guide and we believed in you.
You did not fail us.
Your dynamism, dedication, deep sense of duty, brilliance and discipline are few of the many virtues that we were in awe of and, in our modest ways, tried to emulate.
My family and I will forever be grateful to you for sacrificing yourself for our nation.
In the next karmic cycle, I wish to be somewhere close enough to you to be able to serve you. In the meantime, a part of you will always be with me.
Here is a virtual farewell hug…which may displease you, but what the heck, you are our father – the father of Singapore.
See you soon .
Saraspathy Menon

Dearest Mr Lee,
You are a remarkable and respectable leader that made a difference during tumultuous times. We are glad and grateful that we have you as our founding father. Your dreams, convictions, dedicated lifelong service had changed an unsightly fish village into a pleasant, safe and peaceful country, a bustling and cosmopolitan city where we are proud to call home.

Under your remarkable leadership with you team, leading a group of elite and hardworking fellow mates, people of young generations are the beneficiaries of the fruit of your labour. Without you making a difference during the tumultuous times, travelling to different destinations, Singapore won’t be what it is today.

Although you have left us, your legacy, passion and perseverance will live on forever. We are grateful and honoured to be part of the generations where we witnessed your remarkable leadership. Though you won’t be able to witness the changes with us, we know that you are watching over us at your new home with Mrs. Lee.

50 years ago, you shed tears for the nation. 50 years later, the nation you have dedicate your life shed tears for you. You brave through challenges in building a nation, you walked till the end of your journey bravely despite all circumstances. Nothing stands your way is what I have witness through days of mourning. It clearly shown that you have touched the lives of people you accounted for, Singaporeans from all walks of life and even across island wide.

Thank you for all the sacrifices you made for us, your dedicated lifelong commitment and contributions to Singapore. No amount of words can expressed our heartfelt gratitude. You have left a great assets to the Singaporeans of generations. Thank you for everything, for what you have done for the nation, the people you are accounted for. You’ll be deeply remembered in our hearts, our founding father. May you rest peacefully and reunite with Mrs. Lee in your new home.

Thank you Mr. Lee for your dedicated lifelong service to this nation and provide a safe and low crime home for people you accounted for.
Our humbled deepest condolences to Mr PM Lee and family. May you and your family brave through all challenges in life. Thank you for letting us, Singaporeans grace the final journey of late Mr. Lee with you.
With heartfelt gratitude,
Anson Lim, Lina Yeo, Serene Ong, Katherine Kraylene.L, Eileen Ng

You led Singapore in times of adversity and poverty. You gave your time and life to transformed a sleepy hollow into a global metropolitan. You crafted policies and developed Singapore using your model. You made the little red dot known to everyone from the East to the West. You worked relentlessly for the future of your people. You had been ostracized and condemned for your style. You never succumbed to criticism and rivals. You led your way and did your best for your homeland.


You deserve my utmost respect and deep admiration. Mr Lee Kuan Yew, thank you for being a wonderful statesman. Rest in peace
Kevin

I’ve never actually really thought about this… It seemed to me as though Mr Lee Kuan Yew would live on forever and the news of his death hit me like a freight train when I first read about it on my way to school on Monday morning.
His death was inevitable, but deep down, I was desperately hoping that he would hang in there, at least until the 9th of August, to celebrate SG50 with all of us. Now, though, I am a touch comforted by the fact that his suffering has ceased, and that he has reunited with his wife.
He was a magnificent man and Singapore will never see a man and leader as marvellous as Mr Lee Kuan Yew. He was truly a great leader who gave his all for his country, who made Singapore what it is today. Without him, there’ll be nothing. To this man who made it all happen, thank you so much. Your contributions were tremendous to say the least, your love for the country was amazing, your dedication to Singapore, all your efforts, your blood, sweat and tears… We thank you from the bottom of our hearts and we will not let you down; we will continue to make Singapore shine, prosper and flourish. I hope as you look down at us from the skies, you’ll be proud of us. We’ll keep your legacy alive and every Singaporean, no matter present or future, will know your name, your great deeds, and carry on the legacy.

Mr Lee is Singapore personified. With his passing, an era of possibly a golden era for Singapore.


Born in 1962, I grew up as Singapore grew from a GDP of slightly higher than $500, highest in SE Asia, to over $55,000, one of the highest in the world. I experienced how it was like to be in the third world to first.

Singapore and Singaporeans owns a great debt to men of the calibre of Lee Kuan Yew, Goh Keng Swee, Toh Chin Chai, S Rajaretnam, Lim Kim San, Devan Nair, Hon Sui Sen, and many of the founding fathers. As PM, LKY is the first of the founding fathers. Without them, their patriotism and committment, Singapore is most likely to be a bleak dark dot, instead we have become a bright red dot.

Due to my work, I had been to many countries, least developed or developing nations – Jamaica, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, Sudan, Nepal, Mozambique, Mauritius, Maldives, South Africa, Panama, Colombia, Papau New Guinea – all developing nations.

Some of these, had higher GDP than Singapore, in the sixties.

One vivid ocassion was in Sri Lanka.
I read that Sri Lanka or then Ceylon, was considered a pearl in the Indian Ocean, clustered in a relatively area of peace, unlike Singapore, then battling the communist red tide in S E Asia. Sri Lankans have the bright people. Alas, racial strife wrecked the country for over 30 years.

After a presentation on Singapore’s TradeNet, a Sri Lankan gentleman came to me and thrust me a book he had written.

It was about LKY and what he had done in Singapore, and lessons for Sir Lankans. He expressed profusely about LKY, and I was bemused and slightly embarrassed.

I didn’t yet, fully appreciate that Singapore could have been like Ceylon, if not for the wise policies of multi-racism and bilingualism of Lee and the Old Guards.

As a Singaporean, I did not benefit of all Singapore had to offer. I did not have a benefit of a university education in Singapore, no thanks to the education policies. My gratitude for my university education goes to Australia.

However, LKY’s Singapore provided a conducive environment for me to find jobs and earn a living for myself and my family. The golden era of Singapore in the last 50 years is such, that I did not find emigrating to larger countries like Australia, or the US, enticing. I choose to stay in Singapore, because no where is better or as comfortable as my Singapore home.

Thank you Mr Lee, without you and the Old Guards, your abiding passion for Singapore, had given us this golden era we had in the last 50 years.

I only hope that your younger successors in the Government, and the PAP will have the same kind of indomitable spirit, and the abiding passion for Singapore, to lead Singapore to a even golden era for the future generations of Singaporeans.

Many Australians share a profound respect for Mr Lee and revere his courage, dignity, profound wisdom and nation-building acumen. We consider him a friend of Australia and many of us wish he was one of our own. Many years ago, he warned us that ‘Australians would become the poor white trash of Asia’ unless economic reform was instituted – a remark which stung Australian politicians to action. To call yourself a ‘mate’ is one thing; however only the very best friend of all will tell you when you are on the wrong path. We say that he was a very great friend indeed.

Thank you for making Singapore as what it is today. Without your tremendous effort in helping out with Singapore’s economy, Singapore will not be as advanced and as beautiful. Thank you for sacrificing your entire life just to help Singapore to be a better place for Singaporeans and foreigners to live in. Your ‘Plant a tree campaign’ helped Singapore to be clean and green and Singapore owned the title, “”Garden City””.


Mr Lee Kuan Yew also pursued in Singapore’s education system, to allow every Singaporean child to have the opportunity to be bilingual, therefore, resulting in the Lee Kuan Yew bilingual scholarship.
Thank you for all your wonderful contributions and striving so hard just to make Singapore a better place. Now, all your hard work, tears and sweat have all paid off.
Once again, I would like to say a sincere and grateful thank you to you, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the Founding Father of Singapore. I am very proud to tell others that I am Singaporean and I can call Singapore my home.

饮水思源

Yours sincerely,

痛失一位这么勇悍，富责任感，具远见和智慧的领导者，心情实是无比哀痛。然而沉溺在深深的哀悼时，别忘了回报他最好的方式是好好地生活，力求种族和谐，社会安定和继续发展。


让我们一起向这位一代巨人深深地鞠躬，因为有他，才有现在的新加坡!

别忘了人家是建立一个家庭，而李先生不只建立一个家庭而且还建立了一个国家! 我们应该把沉痛的心，忆念他的心，转化成力量，竭力把现在的新加坡维持下去或甚至打造得更完美! 我相信这样，李先生他会很高兴的。
安息吧！我们的建国总理李光耀先生。
您会永在怀念中。

Dear Mr Lee, a simple thank you is not able to express the gratitude we have for you. Without you, there won’t be a Singapore today. Along side with the pioneer Singaporeans, you have built a safe, clean and fair country for our children. As long, you work hard you will be treated fairly and have a chance to be successful.


When I drive to work yesterday, I saw the flowers along ECP are all blossomed beautifully which is a sight I never seen before. As if it’s saying good bye to the gardener of Singapore, Mr Lee Kuan Yew!

Thank you Sir for everything. May you rest in peace!
Jacky

I’m sorry that I couldn’t make it to the Parliament House to pay my respects personally. Instead, I’ve went to one of the community sites instead. I hope you don’t mind that..


No amount of thank you can suffice the contributions and sacrifices that you’ve made for this nation that I’m proud to call Home. But still, Thank you Sir. You’ve worked so hard for Singapore, thinking about her for every living breath you’ve had. You were selfless, placing Singapore above anything else. You’ve been a great inspiration to many of us, and I’m sure you will continue to be for the future generations.

It has been extremely heartwarming to see Singaporeans queuing to pay their last respects for you, and the kindness from my fellow Singaporeans. And Sir, this is all because of you. Growing up, I’ve always thought of Singaporeans as selfish and un-united. But they’ve proven me so wrong, and I thank you Mr Lee, for uniting us Singaporeans once again.

You’ve done so much and it’s time to take a break. As much as my heart is heavy with sorrow, I’m also glad that you’re free from pain and suffering, and that you’re finally reunited with your love of your life. Thank you too, Mrs Lee, for without you, Mr Lee would be a different person, and Singapore might have not been how she is now. I hope that both of you can continue to watch over us from wherever you are, and know that because of the strong foundation that you’ve given us, we will make Singapore shine even brighter than she is now on the world map.

Thank you and Rest in Peace Sir.

Rest in peace esteemed Mr Lee Kuan Yew. i am deeply saddened by your passing. With your passing, it has created a void in Singapore and the hearts of all Singaporeans. But it will be filled with a fond memory of you and all that you have done and fought all your life for Singapore to be what it is today. For that we are eternally grateful. Today as always,I stand proud to be a Singaporean. Anywhere we go we reply with pride that we are from Singapore and with the equal pride when people from all walks of life and country acknowledge with envy what Singapore stand for.


Blessed are we Singaporeans to have had you to guide us and lead us through the times. Even with your passing, your spirit lives on. We will never forget.

In Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s own words: “You begin your journey not knowing where it will take you. You have plans, you have dreams, but every now and again you have to take uncharted roads, face impassable mountains, cross treacherous rivers, be blocked by landslides and earthquakes. That’s the way my life has been.”

“”But we are not an easy-going people. We cannot help thinking, calculating and planning for tomorrow, for next week, for next month, for next year, for the next generation. And it is because we have restless minds, forever probing and testing, seeking new and better solutions to old and new problems, that we have never been, and I trust never shall be, tried and found wanting.’””

With heartfelt gratitude, thank you esteemed Mr. Lee Kuan Yew. Rest in peace.
Toh Jia Song

Dear Mr Lee,
I am nine this year. Mummy and Daddy took me to the p.house to see you. But I only see Singapore flag. Mummy told me that is you.
You have built a nation so so pretty. I love all the flowers in the park. Big kisses and thank you
Janet Lim

While reading through the condolences, I’m reminded of a couple of lines from Paulo Coelho’s Aleph:

“”Words are tears that have been written down. Tears are words that need to be shed. Without them, joy loses all its brilliance and sadness has no end.””

Was struck by the profound connection between words and tears. The many tributes have contained words of gratitude towards our founding father, while eulogies by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his brother Lee Hsien Yang have certainly struck a chord in the hearts of those who have loved and lost. The tears of those grieving speak volumes of the immense respect for MM Lee Kuan Yew.

I’ve been very touched by the eulogies. MM Lee Kuan Yew has led a sparkling life and the anecdotes that were shared showed a softer side, a side that all of us can relate to, a side that we’ll fondly remember.

My heartfelt prayers go out to Prime Minister Lee’s family. Know that our thoughts are with you during this difficult time.
Maggie Chen

Dear Mr Lee,
Since the day you left us, I have watched so many videos of your younger days when you did your rally speeches. I have watched how you fought for the independence of Singapore and have admired your conviction and determination in building up a nation. I am deeply touched whenever I witness your devotion for Mrs Lee. You are so much more than I thought I knew about you.


Thank you, Mr Lee. Thank you for your years of hard work and commitment in building this nation. Everything that we are enjoying now, is the fruits of your labor.

I have been thinking these few days on how I can best pay tribute to you, to thank you for all that you have done. I guess the best way that I can possibly do, is to promise you that wherever that I might be in the years to come, I will still come back to Singapore, the nation that makes me proud, the roots of my identity and the home where I belong.

Just yesterday, my friend asked me all of a sudden, whether will I leave Singapore and migrate to another country for retirement. I told her, “”never”” I will not leave behind a nation which is built on tears and sweats by our forefathers. I promise to treasure Singapore and all that has been built for us.

May you rest in peace. You will forever be in my heart and the hearts of our fellow Singaporeans.
Eve

Dear Mr Lee,


We have not met each other,but you have managed to touch my life in many ways.without Yew,Singapore will not be Singapore today.My life is through the hard works of yours.
Ah gong,thank you for your sacrifice what you have done are for this nation,for the people in Singapore.I am proud to be a Singaporean. You may lay your burden down now. Singapore will miss you with love and admiration.

Miss you forever
MK.Low

I am who I am today, a proud and grateful Singaporean, because of you.
My father was an ardent supporter and my mother a quiet admirer. The rest of us in the family were devotees. Yes, in many ways you were our supreme guide and we believed in you.
You did not fail us.
Your dynamism, dedication, deep sense of duty, brilliance and discipline are few of the many virtues that we were in awe of and, in our modest ways, tried to emulate.
My family and I will forever be grateful to you for sacrificing yourself for our nation.
In the next karmic cycle, I wish to be somewhere close enough to you to be able to serve you. In the meantime, a part of you will always be with me.
Here is a virtual farewell hug…which may displease you, but what the heck, you are our father – the father of Singapore.
See you soon .
Saraspathy Menon

You led Singapore in times of adversity and poverty. You gave your time and life to transformed a sleepy hollow into a global metropolitan. You crafted policies and developed Singapore using your model. You made the little red dot known to everyone from the East to the West. You worked relentlessly for the future of your people. You had been ostracized and condemned for your style. You never succumbed to criticism and rivals. You led your way and did your best for your homeland.


You deserve my utmost respect and deep admiration. Mr Lee Kuan Yew, thank you for being a wonderful statesman. Rest in peace

Kevin

Being born in the 90’s, by then I had a stable home to live in, clean water to drink and bath in, a good education system. I had no idea what poverty was till I got older and saw images of people from Africa having to both drink and bath using mud water. It was then that I felt very very lucky to have been born and raised in Singapore.


From being a newly independent country back in 1965, I am amazed at how you, Sir, has stepped forward to lead and transform us from a third world country to first world with your courage, foresight, determination, and firmness within a short span of time. How big of a role you must have played for us in the international stage too.

I may not have met you before, you may not have impacted my life directly, but it feels as though I’ve lost a grandfather if I may say. You have done a tremendous amount of things for your people, your country, for your entire life. There will never be another magnanimous man like you again.

I hope you’ll have a good rest now, thank you very very much, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
Huiting Zuraidah

Dear beloved Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


I regret that I only get to know so much more about your sacrifices, thoughts and concerns for Singapore after your passing.

Your passion, tenacity and decisive actions have helped Singapore overcome its darkest moments and challenges through the last 50 years. Your farsightedness has given us a stable and able government; a capable team of younger leaders to carry us through the next chapter of the Singapore story.

No amount of words or actions can fully express my heartfelt gratitude. Please accept this as a small token of my appreciation. Your fearless fighting spirit will continue to live on.

Rest in peace Mr Lee.

Tribute to our founding father Mr Lee Kuan Yew


1923-2015

You are indeed profoundly intelligent, compellingly articulate and obsessively passionate legacy world class leader as they said.

You fought hard to lead Singapore out of a turbulent and uncertain era and shaped her into a first world country.

We can never find another great man like you. You have dedicated your entire life with selfless sacrifice and protected our country with all your heart & soul. Your tremendous contributions and perseverance has made this little red dot roar like a lion and made significant influence to the world.

I pray that our nation will continue to build on the invaluable foundation that you have laid for us and make Singapore a better place where we call home. Without you, we wouldn’t be enjoying a safe, clean, green and efficient first world garden city.

THANK YOU for not giving up on us! You will always remain in our hearts. You have made us proud. I am proud to call myself a Singaporean!

I salute you with highest honour & respect

Your fellow Singaporean.
Ivy

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


We have been truly blessed as a nation to have benefited from your strong foresight, leadership and governance. You shouldered tremendous responsibility in steering Singapore to economic excellence and gave us all a sustainable home. My generation has been so fortunate – we did not live through the tumultuous times, but the lessons learnt will be deeply etched in my mind and for this I am eternally grateful.

We will continue to champion your spirit of excellence and make you proud of us for generations to come. I am so proud to call myself a Singaporean and I will tell my future children all about what you have done for Singapore. Thank you for first believing in us. God bless you and your family.
Kong Yi Ling

Dear Sir,
It is with a heavy heart that I am writing this. I have not had the chance to meet you in person. The closest distance between us was when I paid my final respect to you at the Parliament House.


Our founding father, I would like to say “Thank You, Sir” from the bottom of my heart for dedicating your life to Singapore. From a third world country to the first, those tough decision and leadership that you have to make, our clean water, garden city, home ownership, and many more… Without your dedication to build this little red dot, Singapore will not be what it is today. You have definitely made a huge impact not only to all Singaporean but to the world. We are blessed to have you as our leader. I am proud to be a Singaporean and we will unite to continue your legacy.

I am also deeply moved by your love for Mrs Lee and am glad that you now can now be reunited with her.

Rest in peace, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. We will miss you deeply and you will live on, deep in our hearts always.
Elaine Tang

Dear Mr Lee,
I thank God as He has blessed Singapore with a visionary leader that love this country and willing to give his whole life to build this a better place for generation after generation. As I travel very often, Singapore is always the only place I feel like home. Even as I’m married to a British person, and grant me a good opportunity to change my citizenship but this has never been my thoughts as I’m proud to be a Singaporean.


It is definitely our great loss of your departure but we can see that your final days, you had brought the entire Nation closely together as one Singapore. In addition, we can see publicly declare your contributions via social media were overwhelming and once again remember your contributions to this country.

May the comfort and peace of God with Your family and once again I thank you for what you had done and I had been so much interested in Singapore history because of you.
Serene Lee

Farewell, Mr Lee Kuan Yew

…… The Founding Father of our Nation;

….. the Founding Partner of our Firm.

+++

We join the multitudes to mourn the physical loss of your comforting presence.

You gave your best to lead us to achieve so much in your illustrious and long life. Your eminence as the guiding light and moving inspiration was not just for our nation but also the international and global stage!

Your exemplary, indomitable and sacrificial spirit in demanding excellence first from yourself, even as you lead and demand from others around you, has galvanized and made Singapore to what it is. You gave your life… but the past few days have shown that even in death, your spirit lives on to galvanize and move the multitudes for good!

We are proud that the same spirit of excellence and integrity by which you established Lee & Lee with your fellow founding partners, has been entrenched through the past 60 years into our hearts, our hopes, and our aims.

No one like you shall pass our way again… but we shall be forever grateful and humbled that we are direct beneficiaries of your legacy as our rich heritage.

On our part, we shall persevere with dedication, inspired by all that you are and have left for us.

Rest in Peace… Mr Lee Kuan Yew

“Though nothing can bring back the hour of splendor in the grass, glory in the flower, we will grieve not; rather find strength in what remains behind.” – William Wordsworth

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
Me and my family was deeply saddened when we hear about the news on Monday of you passing away. We offer our deepest condolences to Mr Lee’s family as losing a family member is never easy. 50 years ago you have cried for our country and all of us, now we will mourn and cry for you as we have lost one of the best leader of Singapore. We have always been thankful that we lived in Singapore as it has been a safe and clean country and it is all thanks to you that our country has been in this way.

Many thanks to Mr Lee for giving all of your entire life into building Singapore up from a 3rd world country which was a village to a 1st world country which is now a Metropolis City. It is because of your all your blood, sweat and tears that everyone in Singapore gets to live a enjoyable life with all the necessities required.

Singapore is a miracle that you have created. You have created a place whereby many of us can live peacefully. Thanks to your leadership and all of your efforts that all of this is possible for all of us. I am sure that every Singaporeans will be very proud for having Singapore as their home and having you as our founding father of our home. Even though Singapore does not have any natural resources to build up, we have one good leader that lead us and stand up for our country and this is even better than having those natural resources.

Many new generations will not know how much sacrifices you have made to build this country to where it is now. One of the world wealthiest and most developed countries. They also wont know what is it like to live in a 3rd world country and the sufferings. Many of us take things for granted and only express our thoughts when it is too late. But Mr Lee, thanks to you that the new generations won’t have to go through those sufferings.

No words can ever express our gratitude to you for everything that you have given up for our country and for all fellow Singaporeans. We are blessed to live in Singapore, the fruits of your labour. Your legacy will be carried on by all Singaporeans and the memory of you will continue to live and be respected in our hearts. Let Singapore be all Singaporeans burden from now on and we will shoulder it and continue to bring the country to greater heights. May you rest in peace and God bless you.

Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, it is with a great sense of gratitude that I paid my final respects to you in the wee hours of 26 March 2015.


The beauty, orderliness and cleanliness of modern Singapore owe their beginnings to you and the capable team that you assembled in our early years.

Empowered with vision, you saw the potential of modern Singapore and worked tirelessly towards building a nation that we are now proud to call our own.

Your strength as a leader has not gone unnoticed by our neighbours or the international community. It was this strength that galvanised a people of diverse backgrounds and beliefs. It is this strength that won you the respect of your people and those around you.

Leadership is, indeed, no easy task. Despite much opposition, you made difficult decisions, many of which you believed were for the good of our island nation. Many of these decisions turned out to be the correct ones. Of course, being as human as the rest of us, there is no doubt that mistakes were made. Some policies were unpopular and some actions were controversial. Nevertheless, it is my belief that these were outcomes that were already weighed and discussed. It is inconceivable that a man blessed with such foresight would not imagine the results of his words, actions and decisions.

Mr. Lee, I believe that you did the best you could with what you had and I am immensely appreciative that we had a leader who was as courageous as you even in the toughest of times. Thank you, Sir, for trailblazing us to where we are today.

Though I have not known you in person, I know that your heart and soul were devoted to the rise of modern Singapore. Though I have not seen you in person, I see the vision you had all those years ago in the fruit of your labour all around me. Though I have not heard you speak in person, I have witnessed the gravitas and power of the words that you have spoken.

In your passing, we are deeply grieved at the loss of one of our great founding fathers. Thank you, Mr. Lee, for all that you have done for us. You have served this nation with your life – a life that will be forever inscribed in the annals of history, never replaced, never forgotten.
Remus Zhong

Sir,
I was born in the 60s when you made Prime Minister. My family and I lived in a kampong in Poh Huat Road, off Upper Serangoon Road. As kids growing up, we felt the impact of every policy you made such as Speak Mandarin Campaign, Housing Policy, 2 is enough, etc.. We cared less about the impact of your policies because we were more interested in flying kites, catching birds and fishing in the ponds. Sometimes, we would listen to the adults as they gather to talk about your plans for our neighbourhood and the country. My grandfather was a civil servant then and he would leak some information about the Government plan. As kids, we sat there listening and watching the reaction of the elders. Some were angry especially with regards to the land acquisition act. Some were elated to hear that they could finally have a proper home to live in. As you can imagine, kampong houses back then were made of attap and zinc roofs, wooden beams and walls (infested with termites) and erratic electricity supply (especially during rainy days when the overhead power cables would snap because a branch fell on it).


Today, as I look around me, I understand why you had to do what you need to do. I see the fruits of your labour. Some of your policies were hard to stomach but we trusted you and you delivered. For that, we will forever be grateful. You have done your job and you paid for it with your life. Nobody will ever come close to achieving what you have done. Nobody can ever emulate you. Whenever I see videos and pictures of you, one word comes into my mind; style. That’s right, style. The way you carried yourself, interact with higher dignitaries, communicate with people from all walks of life, understanding their needs and passion, being firm and even ferocious when needed, sympathetic and caring to those around you and jovial at the right time are qualities which resonates with me.

As an ex-Naval Officer, you were also my Commander-in-Chief. If you had shouted ‘charge’, you can be sure a thousand sailors will set sail and defend this country with our lives. This is our home which you have built for us and anybody who tries to take it away from us will feel the might of our guns and missiles. This country is truly worth fighting for.

As you proceed to your final resting place, I want you to know that your ship is in good hands. The Command team has proven themselves and the morale of the crew is high. There will be some slackers but don’t worry, we will sort them out! Bon Voyage Sir Lee Kuan Yew, you were the best Commander any officer can work for. Pipe the still……
Gabriel Tan

Receiving the Prime Minister’s Book Prize in 1984 was one of the high points (if not the highest) of my school days. As I join fellow Singaporeans in saluting Mr Lee, I look back in wonder, not just at that honour I had received from LKY himself, but also at his foresight in establishing the policy on bilingualism.


It is often said that we must give our children both roots and wings. In a way, that is what bilingualism has done for Singaporeans. Our mother tongue keeps us rooted in our culture, while English serves as a portal to the wider world – in effect, giving us wings. I look back in wonder and respect as this was just one of many things he set in motion with his astounding foresight.

Anyone can dream, but it takes someone special, with extraordinary courage and determination, to translate that dream into a vision, and galvanise an entire nation to march with him to realise that vision. That march, though glorious, has undoubtedly been a long and difficult one.

Rest in peace, Sir.

With deep and abiding respect
Jareena Salih

It is saddening to wake up to the news of passing of Mr Lee Kuan Yew on the morning of 23th March 2015. On that very day, the whole of Singapore became very silent. I was on the train to work at SGH and the whole journey was quiet and reflective. Everyone in the train was quiet, solemn and you can see some who are upset. Upon reaching SGH, I took a longer detour toward the Quad outside SGH Blk 7 and see a couple of visitors shedding tears. It was indeed a saddening day for the whole nation because we have lost a great man who have built Singapore from nothing to what it is today.


It is sometimes we don’t realise that our country is beautiful, clean and safe until we lose it. We can actually feel it everyday. For example, walking on the streets at 3am and you know that you will be safe. Moreover, we can see the lush greenery that spread out throughout the streets of Singapore including the trees opposite my house are blooming with flowers of white and pink colour.

Your dedications to make Singapore better over the last 50 plus years has shown results and I totally appreciate that. It is your leadership and capabilities to work with your team that brought us to what we are today. I am thankful and blessed to have you as our founding father. No words or actions can compare to what you have done for this country. You will be always be in my heart and in every hearts of every Singaporean.

Thank you Mr Lee, without Yew, there is no us.

Rest in peace, Mr Lee! I am sure that Singapore will be in good hands.

Majulah Singapura!
Then Tze Kang

To the greatest leader of all,
There are many great leaders that has written history, Mr Lee Kuan Yew is however the one that not only do I respect most, but also the one that all Singaporean owe most. Without Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s great fore sight, plans, strategies and belief in Singapore and our fellow country people, we will not have even achieved half of what we have today. From a small fishing village to a first world nation, under the leadership on one statesman, at the same time facing the challenge of no natural resources and many others problem, Mr Lee Kuan Yew has exceeded mankind expectation and limitation.


Thank you Mr Lee for shaping Singapore into what she is today so that each of us has a much better standard of living. I thank you sincerely with all my heart and I will always be proud to say that I am a Singaporean. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.

RIP Mr Lee,

Yours Sincerely,
Wong Wei Kai

I thank you from the bottom of my heart, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, for fighting courageously in the beginning for the independence and survival of Singapore; and for your wisdom in guiding the younger generations of leaders, both locally and internationally, to make Singapore and the world at large a more stable and peaceful place to live in.


You have made our little red dot larger than what it appears and for the whole world to recognise and respect us. I promise to try my utmost best to make Singapore a better place to grow old and die.

The outpouring of tributes for the past few days is befitting a man like you. You have demonstrated great compassion throughout your life, and to a Buddhist like me, this is a mark of a great being, a Bodhisattva.

Om Mani Padme Hum
Lee Liang Tee

Mr Lee Kuan Yew, thank you for your most dedicated efforts to bring Singapore to what our great home is today. You are truly an amazing man, who gave us hope for a better future at Singapore’s most desperate times in the 1960s and truly an excellent leader who brought us better days over the years.


50 years ago, Mr Lee, you brought us together as one united people
50 years later, Mr Lee, you brought us together again as one united nation.

Thousands complain about about the long queue at the parliament house, but still appear at that solemn place awaiting to pay their last respect, simply because hours of waiting nothing compare to the enormous contributions you made. In that hours of waiting, we all had a feeling of familiarity towards each other although many of us had never might each other before. There was this amazing feeling of connection and bond Singaporeans had but never realized.

50 years ago, Mr Lee, you stood before us, all Singaporeans had a common goal, a better tomorrow.
50 years later, Mr Lee, you lie before us, all Singaporeans have a common goal, to send our deepest appreciation and respect to you.

Mr Lee, you are the soul of the Singapore Spirit, you are the blood of Singapore’s veins, you are the father of all Singaporeans.

Thank you Mr Lee, because of you I am proud to call myself a Singaporean.
Davidson Chee

I thank you. I thank you for your efforts to shape Singapore into what it is today. Your hard work has paved the way for physically challenged people like me to come to Singapore and study, enjoy good transport and access most of the places in Singapore.


I first visited Singapore in 2006 on a medical trip. I was highly impressed by the infrastructure, cleanliness, and most of all the safety of this country. I remember telling my dad and mom, ‘I would like to live here one day.’ Two years later, my dad was able to secure a job – his dream of serving children with special needs – as an educational therapist at the Dyslexia Association of Singapore (DAS). I was ecstatic. From then on in 2008 until now, 2015, I have enjoyed every single minute that I have lived in this country.

Me Lee’s legacy has given birth to a fine nation. As a visionary and a great leader, he has excelled in creating a nation that through his nurturing hands, prospered. Once again I thank you Mr. Lee.
Mohamed Zimnaan

Dear Mr Lee,
I always wanted to meet you, and imagined such meetings where I am just awed with your words and the confidence you had for Singapore. You were indeed our father, you took on the burden and assured us with your words, your eyes, your smile, that all will be well.


Today, I met you as you lie in state. I cannot believe that I will not be listening to your voice, and seeing you at NDP. I am ever grateful to you and your team, for building Singapore. I am grateful whenever I walk out of my nice home, to my safe streets and well-structured roads. I am grateful when I see the Singapore skyline, the parks, and our airport. I am grateful.

Today, I move from being just grateful. I want to take actions, and do my part to ensure that your spirit and passion for Singapore lives on. That I do my part to protect the Singapore that has been created, and to improve on it further.

The queue to the Parliament House showed that I am not alone. Fellow Singaporeans, young and old are equally spirited and have the will in them to uphold your legacy.

Mr Lee, in your life, you created a Singaporean Singapore. In your death, you reminded us of being united, as one people, for Singapore, for you.

Thank you Mr Lee. May you Rest in Peace.

With Love and Respect,
Rafidah Rahumathullah

Dear Mr Lee,
Your passing comes at a poignant time as I did my national service for the last time this week. I find myself looking back a lot over the various great things that you have done for us through the years and the legacy that you have left Singapore with.


As an early 80’s 3rd generation Singaporean, I am a very fortunate beneficiary of the Singapore system, one which is based firmly on meritocracy, clean government and most of all, guided and moulded by your astute vision and strong leadership. For that, I am very grateful to you.

Yes, I have sacrificed the best time of my youth for the nation through national service but all of these are minuscule and nothing compared to what you have done for Singapore. Without you, I am very sure that Singapore will not be even close to what it is today.

I have not had the privilege to meet with you in person but yet know you dearly through the various policies that you and your government had and have implemented which impact me through my life. I am sure this feeling is something that most of this nation shares with me. Since your passing, countless Singaporeans from all walks of life and foreign leaders unite and come together to pay their last respects to you. I am deeply touched and really feel proud to be a Singaporean. You have truly created and united a very unlikely group of multiple ethnicities, races, religion and language together to forge a nation, one that is very prosperous one in a single generation against all odds.

You are truly a titan amongst men and a constant beacon of light to all of us Singapore for the past 50 years.

Thank you Mr Lee. May you rest in peace.
Eugene Jang

Dear Mr Lee
We may be a small red dot & have no natural resources or hinterland to fall back on but time & again under your wise leadership, we managed to survive & overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges.

Your constant concern & unwavering dedication to seek out opportunities to improve the lot of Singaporeans humble us & you have our utmost gratitude & respect & will always be Singapore’s hero & champion. Indeed Singapore is fortunate to have you as a leader

You are a giant among leaders and bear the mark of a true leader, providing assurance, clarity, vision & direction when the future is chaotic and uncertain.

Your dependability, drive, determination, integrity, foresight, perseverance, conviction, courage, passion, tenacity, single minded mission & devotion to Singapore’s well-being & welfare help create a free, safe, beautiful, vibrant, resilient country with a clean honest political system.

Thank you for establishing a meritocratic & multicultural society where there is equal opportunity for all to succeed so long as one is willing to work hard , regardless of race, language & religion,

Though we are sad by your passing but we are also glad & fortunate & grateful to have you as our leader, as our founding father. We appreciate all that you have done & all the sacrifices that you had to make for Singapore to be a success. .

I trust that you are in a better place. May you rest in peace.

Thank you
Wong Chau Peng and Family

Mr Lee sir, thanks for giving us a good nation to live in. As Singaporeans we are well respected by other nationalities because you have instill the discipline in us to grow from young, adult and become a mature human being. Without your tough but well-made rules and regulations, most of the young would have directed their respective life in a wrong concept. One good rule which you conceptualize was to make men serve National Service and to understand the purpose being a Singaporean, why there is a need for everyone to play their role to defend our nation. I admire you as a leader for making this happen.


Today our entire nation moans as you left us. We will still stand strong to defend this swamp which you turned into a concrete slab though the systems you have placed throughout these years. You have foreseen what we need for the next 50 years and how Singapore will be in SG 100. Hence we will fear none. We will continue to move forward as one nation.

RIP Mr Lee Kuan Yew sir, our founding father.

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yee,


Thank you for everything that you had done for Singapore!

I belong to the Millennials Generation, and because of you, I am able to live in a safe and secured environment with comfort, where I call home. Your belief in education and bilingualism will allow me to gain the upper hand when I step out into the industry in a few years time. With these, I am truly grateful to you.

A simple thank you will never be enough to repay your contributions to Singapore, but I believe by carrying on with your legacy and building a better Singapore will be the way to keep you proud.

I hope you are able to witness the bond between Singaporeans ‘as one united people, regardless of race, language or religion’ as we grief while keeping your spirit alive. I hope you’re proud of it and long may it continue.

Mr Lee Kuan Yew – A role model as a fighter, devoted husband and father, and the best prime minister.

May you reunite with your beloved wife, Mdm Kwa Geok Choo.
Gone but not forgotten, Rest in peace, Sir.

Dear Honorable Mr Lee Kuan Yew


I do not have enough words to express my heartfelt gratitude for what you have given us. You demonstrated courage, determination and compassion to build Singapore as it is today. We are nothing but the results of your sheer hardwork of a lifetime. Together with Mrs Lee, who stood by you in every decision and at every moment of your life, both of you have given us shelter we call home, education system to bring our country forward, clean water and a beautiful garden city. All this is made and created by you and your ideologies.

You gave world class infrastructure, a safe and secure home, equality and freedom to practice our culture and religion. You allowed us to speak our hearts and minds, but limited and restricted us, so that we do not hurt the sentiments of others. You took care of your citizens just like a family. You dedicated your entire life to build this nation. And i can only hope as Singaporeans, we put our best foot forward to uphold what the legacy you have left behind. You’re probably the last man of 21 Century who is deserving and worthy of all the respect of people and countries across continents. For generations to come, your stories will be told in many ways. History will remember you, Hearts will cherish you and future will respect you.

With all due respect, I salute you and wish you rest in peace. May you watch us from wherever you’re and feel proud of us in every way.

With Love and Respect,
Khusboo Kumari Pandery

I remember you as the affable man in white in his chauffeur driven car, smiling and waving to me and my friends as your car pulled alongside my mother’s at the Panggong Negara lights. My schoolmates and I were ecstatic. Even then, I knew who you were, but not quite. I understood more as I grew up and have always revered you as the man who gave Singapore the global respect and consideration it otherwise would not have received. Sure we all worked with you, do or die. You were a perfectionist who suffered no fools and we became like you, our founding father, who was always ready for a scrap. Through you, we can walk the world with our heads held high, proud of who we are and where we come from. We are welcomed everywhere we go because our reputation for orderliness, discipline, meritocracy and honesty precedes us. You were afraid that we might dismantle all that you’ve done, that we might not have the will and intellectual fortitude to do the right thing for Singapore. Well, you can rest now, on the assurance that your people have come out in their millions to tell you that they will not let you down. Wherever we may be in the world, we will carry our heritage with pride and work together to make Singapore a better place than when you left her. It was a pleasure knowing you even if it was for a fleeting moment. RIP Mr Lee.

Dear Mr. Lee Kuan Yew


When I heard you say that you had given your life to build a successful Singapore, I am very touched. Who is willing to give up his life for a cause such as this, if he does not care; do not believe at all and do not commit with his whole heart to persevere and work towards it, regardless of the cost and sacrifice he has to make.

I often wonder where and what I will be if I am not born in S’pore. I thank God that I am born in this nation especially when I see how blessed I am as compared to others. I am thankful that many people of your generation had contributed tremendously to the building of this nation that I can now call my home. It is my precious home indeed.

About our society, I am thankful that you have try to make us different, having and preserving good social and moral values. You want us to be a society with a big heart that cares for others. Thank you for the numerous self improved campaigns (that make Singapore so unique) and your strong emphasis on bilingualism. Thank you for being bold to implement them even when they attract criticism and grumblings because you believe it will be good for us at the end. Our society is definitely more cohesive and gracious now. And we can all have a good head start in life through exposure and good education provided for us, as long as we are willing to work hard. Thank you!

You are unique and I thank God for you. You have left your footprints in history. We will surely miss you!

Everyone is deeply saddened by Mr LKY’s departure. Although life and death is part and parcel of life, it still hurts big time and it’s tough to accept when it happens. Mr LKY is a great man, great leader, great husband and a great father to the whole nation. Without him, there will be no Singapore, no us and no place which we can all safely and comfortably call it home. Now that he has left us and resting in peace, he will not be forgotten. His contributions to the modern Singapore today will be remembered by all. As we mourn over the loss of this great man, we will stand united as SINGAPOREANS and further develop Singapore with his visions in mind. May you rest in peace.


Gone but never forgotten….
Halena Chua

Dear Sir,


We Singaporeans are mourning for the loss of you. For the past week my heart aches, throat tight and tears well up each time I see a report, article, picture or video of you…they are everywhere I go.

I have already known since I was little how much you have done to build Singapore into where we are today…I think somehow this has been ingrained in every Singaporean’s mind.

For the past week, I have learned much more of your many sacrifices, struggles, toils and contributions in developing Singapore, which I truly believe..with your best and only intention to give all Singaporeans a better tomorrow, a better life. I have also gained some insights into snippets of your daily life through interviews of your family, friends, staff and comrades. I have learned and touched by the soft side of you as a loving husband, caring father, thoughtful friend, demanding yet reasonable boss. I’m amazed by how simple and frugal personal lifestyle you have lived !

I especially admire your single-mindedness and courage to tiredlessly search and explore, consider and deliberate, decide, implement and see it through policies you think best for Singapore and its people, even though you knew that some may be unpopular policies. You knew that Singaporeans would realise and understand that this is best for us when result prove it. I think this kind of belief, spirit, attitude, determination and courage is what you hope for in the younger generation government, and that Singaporeans would continue to support and have faith in the present and future Singapore govt…I think this is one of your main concerns too.

I do have faith in the present govt, and I believe they would continue to do and give their best. So, thank you Sir, and rest in peace. You’re greatly, greatly missed.

Dear Sir,


A big bow and salute to you as a sign of my uttermost respect for who you are and what you have strived to make Singapore to be today. I am very blessed to be growing up during the times when you started out to ‘grow and develop’ our nation. You have set high standards for all Singaporeans to achieve and follow.

Though I now live abroad, I am always proud to say that I am a Singaporean and can hold my head high by what our nation has achieved. Though there were controversies in some of your policies and systems, we know that your intentions are always for the good of the nation. You were a man of integrity and you have lived your life standing by what you believed in and I truly respect you for that. As one who grew up and educated in Singapore, I am proud to say that some of the values that you have instilled in us as a nation are still the ones I have taken on as my values – to work hard and to achieve to a high standard of my abilities.

Your demise has stirred in deep emotions within me. As a nation, we are saddened by your passing. But I can truly congratulate you on the passions you have in this life on earth – a celebration of a life well lived; one of which is Singapore, and the other, your beloved wife and family, both of which you have succeeded in growing and loving.

Thank you for being such a great example to us as our founding father. My prayer is that Singapore’s current and future leaders will continue in your legacy to grow and ‘love’ Singapore with the integrity and steadfastness you have left behind. Both acts are certainly tough acts to follow.

Thank you also for the multiculturalism identity you have made Singapore to be which has enabled Singaporeans to be more tolerant of people of other races. This trait is definitely unique to Singapore and not many countries have this to show for.

To end this tribute, I would also like to extend my deepest condolences to Mr Lee Hsien Loong and the whole family for the loss of a loved one.

Let us all continue to pray for this nation that one man had set out to mould and grow into what it is today – a well known city all over the world.

‘Let all supplications, prayers, intercessions and thanksgivings be made for all people (of Singapore) , for kings (PM, Cabinet Ministers and leaders) and all who are in high positions, that we (Singapore) may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way.’ 1 Timothy 2:1-2

You are like the man as described in the Book of Proverbs 28:2 – ‘When a land transgresses, it has many rulers, but with a man of understanding and knowledge, its stability will long continue.’

May Singapore’s stability continue to reign with the legacy you left to your successors.

Rest in peace, Sir, You will always have a special place in my heart!

Love,
Suzanne Yap

Dear Mr Lee,

On May 13, 1969, when racial riots broke out in Malaysia, I was four years old. My parents were in Chow Kit Road, the scene of the heaviest rioting. They fled for their lives and, miraculously, escaped unscathed. Shaken, they moved my siblings and I, all five of us, the youngest barely a year old, to Singapore under the care of a guardian, while they remained in Malaysia. It was a tough but well-considered decision. And one they have never regretted.

Time and again, you would be the topic of conversation at dinner time in our household. My parents, in particular, were always full of praise for you. You were singular; a man of your time and beyond.

I am 50 this year. Singapore has been home to me for over 40 years. I married a Singaporean and have 3 children. You would be smiling approvingly if you were still around. Truth be told, there’s no better place in the world than Singapore to raise a family.

I just spent a short three grateful seconds gazing where you lay in Parliament House, bowing and uttering a short prayer. And then had to move on as thousands were waiting to do the same. It felt insufficient given the magnitude of your sacrifice.

On the way home, I overheard a little girl singing her version of “”Majulah Singapura””: “”Mari kita yaya Singapura, macam macam ma guru…”” I smiled, something I could not do much of in the past few days. I am certain she had no clue what she was singing about. But how befitting.

Indeed, “”onward proud Singapore, like a teacher…”” to many cities around the world with our model of sustainable and inclusive development.

Mr Lee, Singapore owes you an incalculable debt. We will always honour the memory of you and celebrate your life, one which you lived completely devoted to building this nation.

Rest in peace, Mr Lee.
Lorinne Kon

Go forward! Your Honour, your wise words are aplenty, but to me, after “”Merdeka””, Your exhortation to us to forge ahead relentlessly as the ONLY way for Singapore to survive and prosper will forever me etched in my mind. It took me many years to understand the true meaning of this word in our National Anthem and I will always remember it. Rest In Peace, your Honour, for we shall be eternally grateful for all that you have done for Singapore, and we shall keep on forging forward! Thank you, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

Wong Soon Hong

Dear Mr Lee,
Your legacy and achievements are for all to see.
You are not only a great statesman, but also a faithful husband, a devoted father and a doting grandfather. What else can we ask from a man like this.


We as Singaporean, are forever grateful to what you have given us and words cannot explain how sad I was when I heard this news. Would love to have you around to celebrate the jubilee year with us but unfortunately, it wasn’t to be.

I was there at SGH last Sunday (22 Mar 2015) to pen my well wishes just before you passes on. I remembered that there was a heavy downpour of rain throughout the whole island and today, during the final send off, it happened again. Maybe it was a coincidence or maybe it was not.

Nevertheless, you have devoted your whole life to build a solid foundation for our future generation and I am sure that the only way to go for Singapore is up.

The citizens have spoken, Mr Lee.
Rest in peace.
Majulah Singapura
Yah Dihao & Family

Dear Sir,

I was planning to drop by Parliament House to pay my last respects or join my parents at the CC yesterday to pen my message, but decided not to as I know I’ll be standing at one of the tables, thinking hard on what i should write. Even as i type this message now, I’m not sure how i am going to start as there are many thoughts running through my head – so here goes.

Growing up, I resented the education policies you made – such as Bilingualism. I hated attending language classes at school, for the teachers taught the language by asking us to memorise the words for 听写，造句. While others excelled at memorising, I was bad at it – I only understood the beauty of my mother tongue and English after I left Secondary School, where I learnt the language slowly at my own pace and by understanding the meaning behind the words used. My creative side was not an advantage during my childhood and teenage years, as it was a stable route to go into business, sciences than the arts in Singapore. As my grandpa would put it, artists only become profitable after they passed away. While majority benefited from the Singapore Education System and Meritocracy, I had a bumpy ride with it.

It’s been years since then, I am now a developer at a small local enterprise – where I can tap into my creative side when providing solutions for my clients. I don’t hate you for what you have done as it must have been hard having to decide the livelihood of the entire nation. Thank you for the contributions and sacrifices you made for Singapore, along with the old guards.

Say hello to my grandpa over at the other side, he’s a fan of yours. : )

We are all shocked and saddened by the departure of our great founding father, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. He was a fantastic man, he gave his life unconditionally to the people of Singapore, and to the world. It is a terrible lost to us, as a nation up shaped by him and his comrades.


Despite his heavy criticisms from his opponents, Mr Lee was a successful firm man of his words. Not many were like him – what he dare to say, he dare to act. He was a man of his words. That what brings him about to be the best blessings to us as a small nation of Singapore. We owe him much that we all live in such comfortable homes and lives. He has brought Singapore from third world to first, where we were respected by the world.

Not only is he a fellow country man of all times, but we do see him as a worthy good example, of a family man. He has his soft side which touches the heart of many.

Mr Lee, Thank you for giving so much to our nation, and your endless selfless giving. We, the citizens of Singapore, and the people of thr world will miss you very much.

May you rest in peace.
Lim Teck Han

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


Our nation will forever be in your debt for your great vision-to turn a fishing village into a metropolis, perserverance-against all odds and opposition, courage-in tumultous times, unparalled love-the greatest any man can have for their country and passion-relentless desire for Singapore to succeed.
All the sacrifices you made and the dedication of your entire adult life so that we may all have a roof over our heads, food in our stomachs, education and employment to ensure our continued survival and to be able to have and do all with peace of mind is the legacy you have left. Exactly as your son, our Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said,””There will NOT be another Mr Lee Kuan Yew””. I cannot agree more.

I believe all of Singapore and Singaporeans share my sentiments and join me in honouring you with greatest respect. Thank you Mr Lee for having gone beyond your duty and leaving us with a country we are so proud to be a part of.

May you rest in peace and be forever united with your beloved wife.

With deepest gratitude and respect,
Fiona KE E-Ling

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


Thank you for the years of relentless striving to better the life of all Singaporeans. You stood tall on the world stage and made your fellow citizens proud, that there is someone from our midst willing to take on the world for our sake. Your clear unwavering positions including that of clean government and meritocracy enabled everyone including someone like me to advance in life in a way that would not have been possible otherwise.

The nation mourns your loss and you will be sorely missed. Going forward we can only build upon your legacy as one people, one nation, one Singapore.
Rachel Lim

On remembering..


It was a cosy time hearing stories from aunties and uncles about vicious gang fights, race riots and curfews in 1970s Singapore. When it was our turn, we glanced at each other. We are one of the youngest in the group and had not experienced how Singapore was pre-independence. But the late MM Lee’s influence on us as civil servants is indelible.

The husband shared that when he went on official overseas trips, he had come across foreigners who ask him “”what made you join the public service?”” They were genuinely puzzled that one would prefer the public sector over the private. As the conversation wore on, he realised that for some countries, government officials were highly distrusted. They also shared that in their country, the path was chosen primarily for monetary gains. I am thankful that the late MM Lee had built a system of governance with intolerance for corruption. Today, monetary reasons as the main motivation for entering the civil service is not common.

The past 5 days of reflection on the late MM’s actions and dedication to the country struck a chord in me. Since stepping into public service, MM’s style has somehow been imbued in my work ethos. The spirit of excellence, the need to think through all angles, the imperative to account to tax-payers, the discipline to write simply and clearly, are some examples of the late MM’s influence permeating through the voices of bosses over the years. This morning I had a laugh when I read the newspapers. A lady had written about how MM inspected the toilet before an opening ceremony. It resonated with me. In the few events I had to organise, I was also taught to make sure that the toilets were clean and had sufficient toilet rolls. In reading the many stories about MM, I have come to understand that similar good practices ingrained in the civil service are mostly attributable to him.

There is much more to be thankful for and we pray that the future generations to come will not forget what MM’s legacy has taught us.

I had never given much thought to the history of Singapore for the past years that I have lived. I thought, “”Singapore’s history does not have much to say. After all, we only have 49 years of history to speak about. That definitely isn’t much as compared to the other countries around the world.”” Unfortunately, only after the passing of the respected Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, has realisation hit me like a 200 pound sledgehammer. Singapore’s history, although short, was one extremely well crafted by the late Mr Lee.
Sure, I definitely knew that many people respected the late Mr Lee but I never knew to what extent and for what reasons. For that, I am extremely ashamed of myself to not have bothered about my own country’s state affairs. Whatever had happened or whatever will happen, didn’t matter to me at all. For me, all I wanted was to study hard then think of a possible immigration to other countries in the future. Or rather, my future. Singapore, was simply a ‘stepping stone’ towards one of my future aspirations. Complaining about the many aspects of Singapore was, like many other Singaporeans, “my favourite hobby”. But recently, the sorrow from all around the world, the 24-hour long queues of people standing outdoors waiting for as long as 8 hours to pay tribute to him, great testimonials from many and how he lived his life, etc. Screamed only one thing. Mr Lee Kuan Yew has touched the hearts of many.
Since the passing of noble Mr Lee on the 23rd of March 2015, people from all around the world have been mourning for him and articles on his noble contributions were being passed around and were everywhere. Important political figures worldwide remembers him as a good friend and a role model. The media and all the commemoration was how I got to know more on about his great doings when he lived.
The charismatic Mr Lee, had lived a long life and had worked his hardest for us every single day since the age of 41. He was diligent and focused in his responsibilities towards Singapore, and everything he did every single day were contributions towards Singapore, whether big or small. He had a vision for Singapore and with courage, he stepped out and shouldered the heavy responsibility, which many viewed as a burden while he did not, of bringing Singapore from a land with nothing to a land that prospers. He had attributed the whole of his life to the building of Singapore from nothing to something. He has given us a home, and a national identity that is extremely worthy to be proud of. He had led us to where we are now. If only we knew about the details on what he done earlier and if only his doings were spoken about widely and shared earlier. It would be less of a heartache for many like me. However so, I fully respect the humility of the late Mr Lee when he lived.
This year Singapore celebrates its jubilee year, commemorating the almost-a-miracle building of the Singapore nation. In the celebration of our past 50 years of achievements, we will again, remember our main catalyst Mr. Lee who drove us hard to where we are today, achieving so much in such a short time. After which, our people with the gratitude etched on our minds and the legacy that lives in our hearts, will work harder than ever, sprinting towards the goal that Mr. Lee has set for the future of Singapore in many years to come. We as the citizens of Singapore, will pledge ourselves to build on the foundations of our pioneer generation, to work as one united people, to build a democratic, justified and equated society to achieve happiness, further prosperity and continual progress for our very own nation in which we call home. 50 years does not simply mark our end.
Thank you Mr Lee Kuan Yew for all that you have done. Thank you for aspiring the Singapore now, then. And finally, thank you, for allowing me to be part of the creation that you and your people have worked so hard for.
I believe, our generation will now feel more than honoured to serve the Singapore Nation. Your teachings will be greatly remembered and may you rest in peace now that you have ascended to heaven, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
Vinnie Lim

I was born here in 1964. I grew up in those difficult times when you, and your team, struggled to build our nation.
Today, my life is comfortable. I had a decent education, have a decent job and managed to build a home here. These were achieved, no doubt, in some ways through my own efforts.
But it was only possible because of the foundations that you, and your team, had laid down for us.
For it was your leadership and your team’s effort that have transformed this little Red Dot to what Singapore is today.
For that, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, sir, I am thankful and grateful. I am living comfortably on the legacy that you have left us.
Thank you.
And to me, sir, you have never left us. You have left us your wisdom, love, passion, beliefs and so much more which can be seen & felt every where on this little Red Dot.
To me, you are Singapore.


Yours faithfully,
S. Hoon

In yesterday’s Special Parliamentary Sitting to pay tribute to the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Minister Ng Eng Hen recounted this of Mr Lee: In 1968, an MP asked in Parliament, how the British withdrawal would impact Singapore. Mr Lee told Singaporeans plainly that the British bases made up 20 per cent of the GNP and tens of thousands of jobs would be lost. To overcome this drastic impact, Singaporeans would have “to adapt and adjust, without any whimpering or wringing of hands, as a way of life which they have been accustomed to over 30 years comes to an end”. When another MP followed and asked if economic aid from the British could ease the effects of the pull-out, Mr Lee’s quick and unequivocal rejoinder was that any aid should “”not make us dependent on perpetual injections of aid from the outside””, that “”…we cannot change our attitude to life, that the world does not owe us a living and that we cannot live by the begging bowl. The best way of meeting the problem is to go about it quietly and intelligently discussing our problems in a low key and with as little fuss and bother as possible.””


It is clear that Singapore would not have come this far without Mr Lee’s brilliant and decisive leadership. Mr Lee was a tough man, and he brought the country through tough times. As a child of the 80’s, I have grown up in relative peace and prosperity as compared to those before my time. The Singapore River was already clean and flanked by gleaming skyscrapers, and Singapore, with its gushing Merlion, had made it as a First World country that many in the region were envious (and some might say, jealous) of. In school, we were constantly reminded that we should not rest on the laurels of those before us, and that we should continue to work hard to progress our nation. Singapore has come this far by being stoic and pragmatic and industrious, and we should not lose these values.

We are still today, a young nation and even as we remember the achievements that have been accomplished by those before us, more importantly we should remember that hardships can come in different forms. It is wise that we do not become complacent nor divisive, and continue to stand united as a one people to weather through thick and thin. Mr Lee shall remain always a great inspiration for my generation and generations to come.
Lee Hui Ying, SLNG

We Singaporeans are blessed to have had such a great leader. We will not be where we are today without him. He fought for us and spent his life building a successful Singapore. Everything he did and every decision he made, was for the good of Singapore and its people. He left behind a huge legacy, and we will continue to build on what he left for us. Thank you so much Mr Lee Kuan Yew!!
Ang Pei Pei, SLNG

They say history is made by great men and I truly believe so. Mr Lee rose amongst common men during the early tumultuous years of Singapore’s independence and shouldered a nation’s hopes and dreams. He led the nation to her success through his wisdom, foresight, grit and a deep conviction to better the lives of fellow Singaporeans. Today, we mourn the passing of a great man. But, we seek comfort that his name shall forever be engraved in the history of Singapore. His vision shall be propagated by every Singaporean. Thank you Sir, for everything you have done for us all.
Lim Bing Yao, SLNG

A day that will undoubtedly leave an inedible mark on our lives. I was deeply saddened and no words could utter the feeling of waking up with the news for the passing of a great leader, the founding Father of Singapore – Mr Lee Kuan Yew. I believe people all around the world are as well grieving over the loss of a remarkable, brilliant leader. My heartfelt condolences to the family and citizens of Singapore.


This week marks a sombre and reflective week for Singapore and many others. I wasn’t part of the generation who lived through the historical transition; neither am I a Singaporean, nor I know Mr Lee in person; I don’t know much about him and the history but the feeling of dolefulness however is overwhelming, that, even photos and news feeds on social medias could make me tear. Words can’t adequately express how I feel and the gratitude for what you have done for your nation.

My heart has been deeply saddened by your loss and touched by your hard works and passion and building a nation. Through the countless articles, speeches, eulogies that I have came across over the week shown me that you are indeed a great leader, a great father of nation, a great husband and as well a great man.

Mr Lee, you were a man with word, never an empty promise. Your love for the nation and the family touches me deep down. My million thank and gratitude isn’t enough for the tangible evidence of your hard work that has benefited me directly and for the values that you have held throughout your life. Without you, Mr Lee, I wouldn’t be stepping on a city with great education and people. Without you, I wouldn’t be fulfilling my dream and aspiration over at the city you have built. I want to say thank you for being supportive of foreign students studying over here; our safety, opportunities, comfortable life and many many more.

The heavens cry as the nation mourns. Here comes the point where we have to bid goodbye. Without you, Singapore would not be where she is today. You have lived through to see your hard work to fruition and your legacy will continue. You will be greatly missed but will forever live in our hearts. Thank you Mr Lee, may you rest in peace.
Jasmine Goh

It was your vision and leadership that led to the success which Singapore enjoys today. You have left Words will not suffice to express our gratitude. Even as we grieve, the outpouring of heartfelt community spirit in the Padang queue, as one united people, stands testament to your life’s achievements. We are indeed blessed to have had you as the founding Prime Minister. I salute you Sir, for your unwavering love for your wife and selfless passion for Singapore. Thank you Mr Lee.
Jan Woon, SLNG

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


You have inspired a nation. You have given us hope. You have taught us important virtues such as hard work, determination, honesty, integrity and respect. Most of all, you have built Singapore to be a place where all Singaporeans have the opportunities to excel and maximise their fullest potential, regardless of our social economic background. For all that you have done for Singapore, we THANK YOU.
John Ng, CEO of Singapore LNG Corporation

“ A public figure, yet a very private man.


We all think we knew Mr Lee, having listened to him speak, scold, demand, guide, stare and point but few have known him for who he really is. Mr Lee was only doing his job. I have disagreed and even been angry with him for being so ‘strict’. Again Mr Lee was only doing his job. Mr Lee took his job very seriously and, one he had dedicated his whole life to.

Today we all get to know Mr Lee for who he really is. Mr Lee cared. Mr Lee cared about everyone and everything. That is how Singapore came about, because everyone and everything mattered.

A man with a golden heart and an intelligent mind. Singapore is so lucky to have Mr Lee guide us through the tough times and laid the foundation for generations to come.

I am 39 this year and growing up, Mr Lee is invincible. Mr Lee was unbeatable. Never wavered and never gave in. Few have such a strong mind. Mr Lee took punches from the very people he cared for and work so hard to provide for. But Mr Lee stayed firm in his belief and for that, we are now the Singapore that we are.

Deeply saddened, eternally grateful. We have no fear knowing this day has come and you are no longer physically with us for you have thought us to be strong individuals, with integrity and confidence, we are ready to take on new challenges the world will continue to face.

Deepest condolences to your family, especially to Mr Lee Hsien Long, who despite his grief, has to carry out his duties as a Prime Minister. Just like you would have done so.

Rest now and be assured that Singapore will sail forth with pride and confidence.

Thank you, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

A proud Singaporean, Grace ..

A everlasting tribute to our Singapore’s legendary founder and 1st Prime Minister.


Dear Mr Lee,

Your profound wisdom, teachings, and governing efficiency have made our little “”red dot”” country elevated to significant world stage. We thank you most profoundly.

I have travelled to many places in the world and the minute I identified myself as a Singaporean, the next comments I received was “”Your country very clean, beautiful, very efficient and you have a great stable Government under Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew””. Everybody knew about Singapore through Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s effective leadership and he was looked upon as a great communicator who had delivered his talks which today were transparent in the Legacy he had left behind to everybody.

Mr Lee Kuan Yew connected Singapore’s businesses with the world and have never waivered from his visionary goal to aim for national economic achievement. Thank you once again.

To list the achievements of Mr Lee Kuan Yew are as boundless as the “”stars in the sky””.

Inspiration from books and past speeches of Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s eternal fountain of wisdom will be the greatest motivation for all to emulate.

Thank you Mr Lee Kuan Yew for your Legacy to Singaporeans and we will miss YOU, the most impressive, intellectual and practical leader of this century.

Rest in Peace and I am confident Singapore’s leaders will carry on your marathon torch and will lead Singapore to a very bright future.

Sending sincere condolences to Mr Lee Hsien Loong & family at this sad time.

Yours sincerely,
Rita Ng Lai Ling

To Mr Lee Kwan Yew – with the inevitable finally coming to pass, I thank you for being such an inspiration over the years I have lived in Singapore.


When I first came to live here, and discovered your profound words and actions that wrote the course of history over five decades, my subsequent years on this island would become a time to really sit up and continually contemplate life’s important questions, and thanks to you, this period undoubtedly helped shape my world view.

More recently, my family discovered that my long lost grandfather served in Singapore during WW2 and was made POW somewhere near Holland Village in 1942. This was something many families had to endure, and indeed hugely significant to you Mr Lee, who was also captured during that time.

With such massive struggle over the years, your boundless passion for life, such dedication to your wife, and an unmistakable frankness to saying what you felt needed to be said remains your inspiring trademark attribute.

Although I never met Mr Lee, I had the privilege of working on one of his tribute films and so hope my very small contribution to honouring his life will play a part in remembering one of the world’s most remarkable human beings.

Rest in peace Mr Lee Kwan Yew – 1923 to 2015
Emile Guertin

At a young age, I believe that Mr Lee has fought for the nation, succeeding in growing Singapore as what it is today. His people, respect him, look up to him and support his decision. I may not have witness major contributions done by him but I always believe that his actions were right and best for Singapore.
His values became meaningful to me – to be a good listener and aim for higher level of education. Thanks to him, we have a higher quality of life and better living environment.
On behalf of my grandmother, who has been a big fan of Mr Lee Kwan Yew, I pray for him to rest in peace and proceed to the next stage of life.
Thank you Mr Lee. Thank you for your greatest effort for Singapore. Thank you for motivating and having faith in your people. May you rest in peace and we will all remember you, your kindness and your rights. The light and brightness of Singapore, as what is represented in your name.

Dear Mr. Lee,


Thank you for all your hard work building this nation. I never knew the amount of dedication you put in and the hardships you went through until I saw the tributes and documentaries after your passing.

From the number of people who turned up to pay their respects to the foreign VIPs who flew in, there’s no doubt you have touched their lives in one way or another. May present and future generation continue to honor you and build on the foundation that you and your team have laid.

Once again thank you and may God continue to bless your family.

Dear Mr Lee


Thank you for all that you have done for Singapore. You have developed Singapore, putting in so much hard work for the nation. You helped us create reservoirs so that we have sufficient water every day. You provided us with good and proper education.
You did not give up on Singapore despite challenges, instead you continued to figure out better ways to develop Singapore. Thank you for having the perseverance. You made sure Singapore did not have riots and also built HDB flats for us to live in because you were worried about our safety. You maintained the clean policy of Singapore, by taking the initiative to sweep the floors.
Words cannot describe my gratitude for what you have done for us.

Tribute to Mr Lee Kuan Yew


When I was a boy, I was suddenly ushered out of the cinema midway through a movie. Outside, I saw police waving batons moving the people away to go home. Curfew followed shortly due to a racial riot between Malays and Chinese.

I experienced two occasions of massive flooding in the ‘60s. I was living on the ground floor of a shop house. People waded in dirty floodwaters above their knees.

These are images of Singapore in the past. We no longer have to struggle through such unpleasant times. Thanks to the strong, dedicated and visionary leadership of Mr Lee Kuan Yew and the efforts of his team. In a short period of just 50 years, Singapore has been transformed. We enjoy racial harmony; we have active, beautiful and clean waterways, and greenery around our ever dense but pleasant built-up and buzzing urban landscape.

I am deeply saddened at the death of our founding father, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Mr Lee has left behind a large legacy for us. He has dedicated his life to make Singapore what it is today. In fact, watching and reading the tributes and condolence messages penned by world leaders, my heart is overwhelmed with pride that his influence and contributions have gone far beyond the shores of Singapore, the little red dot. I am proud that he is more than equal among the great leaders of the modern world. His worldview and the philosophy that he embraced and shared have benefited many world leaders and their countries too.

I have fond memory of my only encounter with Mr Lee, then Prime Minister. I met him in person when I was a young architect in PWD working on the refurbishment of the City Hall building in 1988. He dropped in unannounced to look at the project. He came alone (no big party accompanying) and I was alone too as my senior architect could not arrive in time. I showed him around some of the work in progress. He surprised me with his great attention to details, asking questions about the building materials used, their origin and costs.

His passing is a great loss to Singapore, but we have much to gain from him. He has made us proud to be Singaporeans. We have a beautiful and safe place to call home. I am grateful for his selfless dedication for Singapore. Most grateful is that he instituted a system of peaceful and smooth succession of political leadership. It can ensure that what he tirelessly built will last. It gives us a strong resolve to continue his values and aspirations for an even better Singapore.

Thank you most deeply, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

Dear PM Lee Hsien Loong,
My deepest condolences to you and your family. My prayers are with you and your family members. I thank God for giving us such an honourable man of great intellect and astute leadership, and yet humble and personable, at a time when Singapore needed most. May God grant you peace and comfort during this time of bereavement and continue to bless you and your team with strength and wisdom as you lead Singapore beyond SG50.

Dear Mr Lee,
I have read all your books and was always intrigued by your work for Singapore, but never in my 38 years have I felt this way as I do now having to immerse myself into your world with the flood of TV recordings, speeches and photographs. What struck me was a devotion and discipline to family and nation that provides the deep foundation that drives you. I have been privileged in my career to have met and worked with some esteemed men this world has seen. I have been inspired by some of them no less share some of the traits I see in you as well.


This week, you have provided me a valuable lesson in life. This week, I have begun to cherish my family and nation in a very different but assuring way. This week, I have through your passing become inspired to not just think about our country but what I can do for it. The noise and sound this week are but noise and whilst I know many of us appreciate and are grateful to you, I hope that this does change the complacency I see and allow us not to forget the true cause of your work.

You have loved this country so much because we call this home. We face no suppression today, only our own, in such shallow thoughts when I want an equally good opportunity for my children. And I care too much as you did for your fellow citizens.

Sir, thank you for what you have done. You have laid the foundation and conditions for many of us to continue the flame of hardworking, diligent, thoughtful and passionate spirit and I hope I will be able to do my small part in making you equally proud of us all.

Gratefully and respectfully, Adrian

Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


Thank you for all that you have done for Singapore. We would not be where we are today without your leadership, perseverance and foresight. The whole of Singapore as one, mourns for your passing on, but the whole of Singapore as one, also celebrates your life.

At last year’s national day when I saw you for a brief moment on national television, my heart filled with so much thankfulness and respect for you, and I stood up and clapped for you, the one who gave your entire life for this nation of Singapore. You looked like you aged a lot and I remember telling my family that I hoped so much that you would be able to witness Singapore’s 50th birthday this August. When I heard news that you passed away, my heart was very saddened. This year’s national day (and the rest to come) wouldn’t ever be the same again without your presence.

I feel also very sad that I am overseas now and unable to physically be with my fellow Singaporeans in Singapore during this significant time in the history of Singapore. I wish I was now in Singapore, watching Singapore news and flipping through the newspapers reading stories about your life, and paying my last respects to you. Being away from Singapore at this time makes me realise how much Singapore means to me, as my home and my country, and how much I respect you for all that you have done. My friends and family back home have been sending me short clips of the state funeral and pictures of newspaper articles of how Singapore is remembering you during this time. As I looked through the videos and newspapers, I am heartened to see how Singaporeans have put aside all their differences and have united as one to mourn for your passing.

I’m penning this e-tribute for you, from the land of Nepal, to say thank you. I would not be where I am today if not for your love and dedication to our nation.

You will always be remembered, by me, by Singapore, by the world.
Sherlyn Ang

Dear Mr Lee,


I would like to thank you for all that you have done for us, Singaporean. Your big vision, wisdom, determination and perseverance bring good life to Singaporean. It is fortunate to be born in this safe, clean and comfortable Singapore and I am always so proud to be a Singaporean. Without you, all these wouldn’t have been possible.

I will remember your fighting spirit, treasure the legacy you left us and play my part as a Singapore citizen to build upon this legacy to make Singapore even a better home in many generations to come.

You will be dearly missed and remembered in our heart always. You worked very hard your entire life for us, Singaporean, for a better life, please rest well now and may you rest in peace.

Thanks again.

This is from one of my favorite authors: “Everyone must leave something behind when he dies, my grandfather said. A child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes made. Or a garden planted. Something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die, and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted, you’re there.


It doesn’t matter what you do, he said, so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something that’s like you after you take your hands away. The difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching, he said. The lawn-cutter might just as well not have been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime.”
― Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451

You’re the gardener, sir. May your legacy live on forever.

Dear Mr Lee,


In your passing, I give thanks to you and your team for laying the foundation of this republic. I like to highlight areas deserving praise.

In education, many have been uplifted out of poverty. Education is key to the thinking man. Without the capacity to read and learn, a man is doomed to ignorance. The key to controlling a population is depriving them of education, but you have done the opposite. You have given the populace the key to free themselves, opening up for many to have good jobs and exploring the world. The critics of today is also a product of this education. Without education, many would never even learn to question.

In housing, the modest HDB flat is testimony of good public housing. Many have benefited from a roof over the head, electricity, sanitation and clean water. Many of us take these comforts for granted, failing to acknowledge that these are the results of good governance.

No critic can take away the fact that Singapore is what it is today because of you and your team. You have made Singapore bigger than what it seems.

Thank you, Mr Lee, and may the republic lives on.

Lor

“ Dear Sir,


We are really thankful to you for what you have done for this country. We are enjoying the fruits of your hard work. Your life will always remain inspiration for generations to come.
We will progress and preserve what you have given to us.

Thanks from bottom of our heart. Rest in peace. You will always remain in our hearts.
Medha

Dearest Mr Lee,


Thank you for the numerous contributions and decisions which made Singapore leaped from a 3rd world country to a 1st world country. During this week of mourning, TV has been showing the past Mr Lee Kuan Yew success, it was good for the young generations as they were not born at the time when Singapore has fought for it’s independence. It was then also made known to me that Mr Lee’s contribution and his vision foresight were very accurate and was at all best interest for Singapore. Without fighting independence (Merdeka) in 1965, Singapore will not be a country of itself.
Now, Singapore is no longer a small dot, it is a country full of hopes and I am proud to call it home. This 50 years of transformation made Singapore bloom into a 1st world country where it is clean and green.
No words can express my gratitude, respect, appreciation for you, Mr Lee. Without you, there will never be a Singapore like today.
Thank you Mr Lee for everything.

Prayers to PM Lee and his family,
May Mr Lee Kuan Yew rest in peace.
Alvin

Singapore is my home and forever will be. I’m proud to be called Singaporean. I served my country with all my pride and give my all to this country. Why? Cause of you Sir.


You have made Singapore your life and you made Singapore what it is today. Without your hard work, vision and undying love to unite the people of Singapore, it will be a very different Singapore. As the pledge goes, regardless of race, language or religion, no country comes close to Singapore in terms of living harmoniously and cohesively despite our differences. People can wander in the street late at night and not worrying about their safety. And among your endless and unspoken contributions to Singapore, i truly am grateful for the safe, peaceful, corruption free, well maintained, beautiful garden city that i call Home. No matter how long i am posted overseas for work, i still miss Singapore. Thank you Mr Lee Kuan Yew for everything.

May you Rest in Peace knowing that you have done everything that you could for us.
Lots of Love, Airil, Shereen & Audrina Seet

Dear Mr Lee,


I can never thank you enough for giving us a wonderful Home.. A place that is safe and loving … A place where we are given the opportunity to be educated, to learn and to be ourselves.,, Most importantly, a place to call our own..

Without your unwavering and unconditional efforts and contributions, this wouldn’t be possible.., I’m really ever grateful from deep inside me for all the things you have done for us. Instead of enjoying the fruits of your labour with us, you left us ….there’s no Home without you. You are the Father of this Home you have built. Like any Father, you are always here to protect and shield us from any harm and danger…

It’s sad to say goodbye…your presence will be dearly missed.. You’ll always stay in our hearts and memories… May you rest in peace, Founding Father.,,,

您辛苦了，一路走好，安息吧！
永远怀念您！
With respect, Fong 28 March 2015

Dear Sir,


I was overwhelmed with emotions and unspeakable gratitude towards you, as I walked with thousands of grieving citizens to pay our final respects. I was born in during the period of time when the Mass Rapid Transit project was built, according to my mother. Even though I was not in the era when there was social turbulence, unrest and the implementation of contentious policies, and how things slowly settled down, I was able to witness how the town I am living in, slowly rose into a busy urban site from bare empty grass lands.

Sir, you have spent the entire life, crafting this powerful nation, and upon your passing, brought all Singaporeans closer together. A visionary statesman you are, with powerful instinct, foresight, impeccable ideals and planning, intelligence and wisdom, leading Singapore to the state she is now, and your sacrifices enabled all of us to enjoy the fruits of your labour.

Countless of “”Thank you”” will never be enough to express our gratitude towards what you have done. May Singapore continue to strive, together with us, Singaporeans. Have a rest well deserved, Sir. Rest in peace. We will continue to do you proud.
Aerieath Seng

I am truly blessed and proud to be a Singaporean.
As a youth, I’d only appreciated being a Singaporean as much as my cognition takes me. My pride as a Singaporean was derived from the text in Civics Education. My pride was cognitive.


As a working adult and having worked overseas, appreciation and pride grew from cognition to affection. The appreciation of what I used to take for granted, the law and order, the stability, the development and foresight of our leaders. The praises my foreign friends and associates sing of Singapore elevated my pride. My pride was affective.

As a Singaporean, this week, with the passing of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the term ‘Singaporean’ took on a different meaning. What we are known for : disciplined, hardworking, uncorrupt, etc, were not incidental. These traits were the results of well-planned and thoroughly thought through policies.

This week, Singaporeans showed togetherness, appreciation, gratitude, respect, civic-mindedness.
My pride as a Singaporean was emotive.

As an educator, I will strive impart values to nurture good and useful citizens, to inculate the national identity, to carry on the legacy and to continue to make Singapore a better home. My purpose is clear.

And now, my pride as a Singaporean is instinctive.
I stand with my head held high, I AM SINGAPOREAN.

Thank you, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
Christina Chang KH

Dear Mr Lee,


Thank you for everything you have done for Singapore. You have spent almost your whole life, with unwavering dedication and hard work to build up Singapore to what she is today. Singapore is very fortunate to have you as our 1st PM during the early years.

As more stories of you start to emerge on news & social media, you have gained many more Singaporeans’ respect & admiration, especially from the younger generation who are very fortunate to enjoy the fruits of your labour. We also start to learn more about you, about your frugality & your love for your family & your people. You are even admired & respected overseas.

Mr Lee, you are a good role model for us to follow. You will always be fondly remembered in every Singaporeans’ heart & in future generations to come as a great founding father.
With love & gratitude, Charlotte Neo

Dear Mr Lee,


Thank you for very much for your contribution to building Singapore from a small fishing village into a first world country. Without you, we are not even a dot, but because of your great contribution, we are now a small red dot which shines like a red ruby among a cup of pure crystal.

I live in the time when you are the PM of Singapore. I watch most telecast of your speech. I look forward to your speech each time they were delivered. Although I might not fully understand, I enjoy watching you over TV.

Our day starts with a fresh gush of tap water, which is so clean and conveniently available from home tap. We stay in a safe and secure flat. We open the windows and we see a garden of green, we breathe fresher air.

When it’s time for children to school, public buses are easily available across the overhead bridge. We do not need to walk in mud like those days in kampung.

The children are bilingualists, although I hope they could pick up dialect as well. At this point, they speak English and Mandarin, At least they could interact with the world, for now and in the future.

Without the stability of the country, investors are not going to come in. I previous have a job with a foreign company and at least I have a stable income. I am currently a homemaker as I think that educating children and taking care of them, bring them up well, is as important too.

Thank you very much for all these, I am deeply grateful.

You left. I wet my eyes almost everyday. We no longer can see you LIVE on TV. We lost our precious Great man. No word can express the pain deep in me for losing you, our Singapore Father, Mr Lee KY.

Please take a higher rebirth, Mr Lee.

Dear Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


Thank you so much for building this home for us known as Singapore. Without your limitless love, effort and even spending your whole life building it, we won’t be able to live and stay peacefully in such prosperous country and built our lovely home. No matter where I go or where I am, it always made me proud being born and raised as a Singaporean.

Thank you always, as you took great care to all of us liked your children and paved road for us to walk on comfortably. There were too many things to thank you about and too many things that you had delivered to us making what we are today.

We will always remember you in our hearts and love this Singapore which you had spent your whole life building for us. Rest in peace, Mr Lee.
With love and gratitude, Ray Wong & family, 28 March’15

No words can describe and no actions can express my gratitude towards you. Thank you for being a respectable and loving father to all of us Singaporeans. You have contributed a lot and dedicate your life in building Singapore from a mudflat to a metropolis. Your struggles and relentless efforts is what made us who we are today. Your willingness and unconditional love for Singapore has made us one of the most successful countries, transforming us to a first-world country from a third-world country.


Your vision and foresight transformed Singapore to a global metropolis , therefore I feel blessed to be a Singaporean, blessed to be a part of a country full of prosperity, peace and harmony. This is why I’m always proud to call Singapore my home, a place of comfort and joy. No other place in the world can make me feel safer.

Your courage and strong determination always inspires me. There was always an answer to a solution when it comes to you. No matter how daunting the task is, it never seem impossible due to your persistence and hard will. You may be gone however, your memories and laurels lives on. And Singapore is a living proof. You are a fair, righteous, selfless leader, an examplary model for many world leaders.

You will be dearly missed not only by me and my fellow Singaporeans but also by everyone around the world who recognizes you as a visionary and great leader. Your legacy will live on for generations to come.

It is 4.30am Thursday 26 March 2015 as I am penning this down. This is my personal tribute to Mr. Lee Kuan Yew who passed away peacefully on March 23 2015. I have always told my wife, why does anyone pen down a tribute – who reads it anyway! But here I am writing this, with the hope that in another 50 years time, if I am lucky, I get to re-read this note on how I am feeling during this period of national mourning.


Together with my wife and sister-in-laws, we have just paid our respects to Mr. Lee in Parliament House. The mood as we entered the hall was somber. I was nervous, as I didn’t know what sort of emotions would come over me. A big picture of his was in-front of the casket. I moved along the line, stopped and bowed three times. I was straining my neck to try to catch a glimpse of him at peace. I was half hoping that he would get up and start scolding us – “Why are you wasting time queuing? You don’t have to work tomorrow??!!!” My imagination was punctured by a quiet but fast sobbing of an elderly woman who had to be consoled by her daughter. Despite the men in green trying to move the line out as quickly as possible, I slowed down my pace and tried to linger as long as I could near the casket. This was my only and last chance to be close to a great leader and gladiator of Singapore.

I was probably too young to see or understand the changes that Mr. Lee made to Singapore from the late 1950s. I never lived through the Japanese occupation, the uncertain times when the British pulled out of Singapore, the threat of the communist insurgents or the racial and student riots. I don’t know what it is like to live in slumps or the joy of moving to high-rise flats from these slumps. I have never experienced water rationing or the uncertainty of mass unemployment. Hence I must admit, my feeling of sadness is not at the same level as that of my Father and our Pioneer Generation when the news of Mr. Lee’s passing broke on the wee hours of Monday morning. However, I greatly admire and respect Mr. Lee for his values, passion, single-mindedness, intellect and resolve. As with most Singaporeans, I am grateful to Mr. Lee for dedicating his life to Singapore, without which I am not sure we can enjoy the kind of life that we have right now.
Mr. Lee’s values of hard work, integrity, perseverance, and resilience are even more relevant now in this increasingly uncertain world. Many may not have agreed with his knuckle buster and tough love approach to nation building, but it is something befitting of for that period of time. How Mr. Lee came out of his moment of anguish with greater resolve and then went on to achieve greater things is something I am learning with my own moments of anguish. Mr. Lee’s oratory skills is second to none. His speeches were robust and fiery. I remembered watching all of Mr. Lee’s speeches on the internet whilst preparing for a speech examination for a Business Communications module in university. I even tried to learn his habit of pulling his pants up while trying to make a major point!

On our journey back home from Parliament House, we discussed about the future of Singapore after Mr. Lee. My sister in laws felt uncertain at how Singapore will cope should there be a serious crisis. Will our youths have the toughness, guts and gumption to stand up and be counted? Will Singapore have a soul? I don’t think any of us will have the answer. But I think a good start is to make sure that we never forget the Lee Kuan Yew story and that our youths understand what he stands for and what he had had gone through to make Singapore it is today.

May you rest in peace Mr. Lee Kuan Yew.

“Merdeka! One more time with more feeling… Merdeka!”
Melvin Vu

Dearest Mr Lee,
Thank you, although words alone is not enough to express my gratitude to you. I have chosen to stay away from the historic queuing at the Parliament House area, but tostay home to watch the videos of you from early days to the most recent appearance of you, of what you said, what you did and how you transformed mudflats to metropolis.


I never paid so much attention during history lessons in school. This week, Singapore woke up to the fact that the peace and prosperity that we enjoy, have not come by accident. You are the Godsend gift to my country, my home. If not for you, I wouldn’t be blessed with the opportunities at school, at work and raising my children. I am able to speak fluent and write English and Chinese, only because of you.

I wept a lot this week, just like many others in Singapore. I would miss you. For sure, going forward, as I watch our future leaders perform, I will ponder “”what would LKY have done?””

You physically depart tomorrow. We start a new chapter without LKY. But you will watch over us, right?

Rest in peace, Mr Lee.
Agnes Lim

Dear Mr Lee, thank you for all your hard work and sacrifices you have given to Singapore. There are no words that can express my gratitude and respect I have for you. You have devoted your whole life carving a nation, not for yourself, but for the people of Singapore and our future generations. 50 years ago you shed your tears for Singapore, now we Singaporeans and other parts of the world are shedding their tears for the loss of a true giant leader. It will be very hard to find another remarkable world leader like yourself Mr Lee. Without you, there will be no modern Singapore. Singapore would still be a little red dot among the other big nations. Now Singapore is a big commercial hub, being able to work collaborately with the other big nations in the world. You are not only a widely respected leader but also a kind hearted and soft man, whom many older generations have shared their beautiful encounters they had with you. You will be remembered for many generations to come. Thank you once again Mr Lee. Rest in peace.
S H KOH

I am in that generation of fortunate Singaporeans who have benefited the most from Mr Lee’s leadership. We did not suffer through the formative years of the nation in the early sixties and were largely shielded from the difficulties that the nation faced after Singapore’s separation from Malaysia. Yet, we have benefited from being in a safe and secure English speaking nation with a good quality of life. We benefited from the meritocratic policies which allowed us to train in our chosen profession-medicine. We were sent overseas to the best centres in the world to train with government support. We returned to a much admired healthcare system to do good work. Thank you Mr Lee for our little country that is big in the world’s eyes, for our lives and for giving us a livelihood and a future. May you rest in peace.
Andrew Khoo

Dear Founding Father Mr Lee Kuan Yew,


Thank you for making it possible for my grandparents and parents to make it through the hardships of olden Singapore. For that, I am grateful to you, for I will not be here writing this piece of tribute without your wise leadership for your people.

You do not know me for who I am, but it does not matter. I know what you have done for us. That is, well, important. You built Singapore to be clean, green, efficient and organised for the benefit for all of us. This has made me so proud to be part of Singapore. Maybe this is why I had decided to join the civil service 13 years ago, and I never looked back since. You paved the road for my generation, so that we can do more to continue your legacy.

I was deeply saddened as I listened to PM Lee addressed the nation about your demise on 23 March. It must be really hard for him. It was, for me. I came to the realisation that you are, so much a part of my life, only with your passing on. Indeed, I felt as if an important piece of my beautiful puzzle has gone missing. When I paid my respects to you this morning at the Parliament House, finally, I could choke back my tears no more.

Thank you, Sir, for all your hard work and giving your all, your life, to us. We will stay strong. May you rest in peace.

My deepest condolences to PM Lee and the family of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

Dear Mr Lee,


We would like to thank you for building up Singapore so that we could walk with pride and dignity as Singaporean, able to stand up against our peers in the world.

The Singapore branding has come to be associated with efficiency, trustworthiness and honesty. It is these traits that allow us to punch above and beyond what a small country could do.

In a way the history of Singapore Urological Association mirrors the history of Singapore. We are but a small group of urologists compared to the other Asian countries, let alone the rest of the world. Under the meritocratic system you have created and armed with scholarship by the government, we were sent to top medical centres in the world to learn new skills and technology so that we could bring them back to Singapore and use it for the good of our people. It also helps to put Singapore at the cutting edge of medicine and biotechnology, far beyond most Asian countries. The ties that we have established with experts overseas further seal our fame as a leading regional centre for medical excellence.

We always look beyond the shores of Singapore as you have always proposed and thus our annual local meeting had expanded to become a regional type meeting with overseas experts coming over to share their knowledge, an opportunity that is hard to come by unless you fly over to the Americas or Europe.

Thank you Mr Lee for building up a stable and cohesive nation, gives us immense opportunities beyond our imagination and expand our horizon to look further than our own limitation.

Rest in peace, Sir.

Dear Mr. Lee Kuan Yew,
You had been an inspiration and the pride of all Singaporeans. We cannot thank you enough for your wholehearted contribution to Singapore and Singapore will not be what it is today without You.


Thank you for the tears you wept when we separated from Malaysia. Thank you for the hard work in achieving racial harmony, meritocracy and economic stability. Thank you for believing in your people and leading us for many decades no matter how desperate the situation seemed. Thank you for always putting Singapore’s interest first, always looking out for her until the very end.

Sir, you will be dearly missed and Singapore will never be the same without you. May you rest in peace and continue believing in us, your people, as we work hard for an even brighter Singapore. God bless you.

I was born on 26th Oct 1955 – Pioneer Generation, 2nd Class


I grew up during the tumultuous years of pre and post independence, experienced the racial riots first hand as fighting and killings happened just outside my primary school compound while we were in class, the separation from Malaysia, the British pullout and much more.

I first saw Mr Lee Kuan Yew when my father brought me, a young boy of 7 or 8 years old, to listen to him speak somewhere near the old Change Alley area (I can’t remember exactly where). The first thing that struck me was his booming voice and his body actions, especially his hands, and his facial expressions. He spoke powerfully and with emotion. I did not fully understood the meaning of what was spoken but he gave me the impression that he was a leader, a great leader, that he was someone who would fulfill his promises, someone who would guide us and take care of us and fight for us.

All through the years, my impression of him had not changed from the above. In fact, as I grew up, became more mature and was exposed to lives and conditions in other countries I began to appreciate Mr Lee Kuan Yew even more. His vision and foresight, his belief in himself, his team and his people, his determination to accomplish whatever he sets out to do or achieve, his meticulous planning to achieve his goals for the country, his righteousness and much much more.

What he has instilled most in me, and I believe in most Singaporean of my generation is the need to continually strive to be the best through hard work, honesty, self-sacrifice and compassion to compliment the skills and intelligence needed to perform any job, any role. Most of all, I will forever remember what he had been drumming to all of us from the first day, that we must continually strive not only to be, but to remain, “one united people regardless of race, language or religion”.

Mr Lee Kuan Yew, go in peace knowing that you had achieved what you set out to do and much much more. You had put in place both the hardwares as well as the softwares for the current and future generations of Singaporeans to thrive.

Thank you and God Bless!

Dear Sir,
I regret that I was not able to bid you farewell. Nonetheless I stayed up late in a bid to watch the live stream of your funeral.


Sir, you are an inspiration to us all. Singapore did not deserve you, it was too small a stage for you. I do not know what Singapore did to deserve you, but it was our luck that we did. I thank you, founding father, for the security and the prosperity you have brought to our nation. Whilst your policies were never short of critics, many of us have benefited from them unknowingly. Sir, even whilst people of my generation have been said to be unacquainted to the trials and the hardship your generation has been through to secure our future, your legacy lives on in us. For that, we are forever grateful. Indeed, without your work on Singapore, many of us would not be where we are.

Sir, there will never be another like you. Singapore was too small a stage. Even many have known your name but not Singapore’s. Yet, we, your people, will remember you not merely for your wit and your combative nature, your frankness and honesty that has earned the respect of world leaders, but we will remember you for the life that you have sacrificed to build this country from scratch, for the tears you shed for us. Today, we shed tears for your passing.

Sir, if not for you, i would not be in the UK studying law now. I have seen you only once whilst having a lunch at Raffles Hotel. I remember being surprised at how tall you were. Sir, even though I do not know you personally, I will aspire to live by your virtues. And even though I have not witnessed first hand the development you have brought to Singapore, I am grateful for the comfort that I was born into. Singapore lives on, a grateful people who will continue your legacy.

Sir, you were too big for Singapore. We never deserved you. You were not a man of God, but perhaps you were a man from God. Sir, we will fly the flag proudly wherever we are, wherever we are planted.

Rest in peace, we will continue your legacy.
Gabriel

A man whose fearless character and love for the nation will never be forgotten.


A voice that spoke foresight, that understood the vitality of change, perseverance and resilience to continuously improve ourselves and our country.

A heart that lead with our other founding fathers, the hope for the succession of better days, security and community.

A founding father and inspirational leader whose legacy lives on in each and every Singaporean.

**

What we remember of who Lee Kuan Yew was, is what he himself would have wanted each of us to be; for our nation, for our home, for our loved ones and for ourselves.

May we find it within each of ourselves to do the same for future generations, the way we look back in heartfelt gratitude to what one man’s life and his team painstakingly and tirelessly strived for us.

May the Lord continue to watch and shower blessings upon Singapore and her people, as we continue to evolve together to build each other up in love, kindness and generous community. In Jesus’ name, amen.
Ruth Lim

Dear Mr. Lee Kuan Yew
Thank you for everything that you have done for Singapore Sir.


Looking back at time when you came into office and following the separation from Malaysia, there was uncertainty as what to do next but you and your team of old guards labored hard and restored confidence in the people and delivered what you promised. A better Singapore for all to live in harmoniously regardless of Race, Language or Religion and most importantly creating the equal opportunity for all Singaporeans to progress together leaving no one behind. This is the unique Singapore that you visioned and delivered during your life time.

No where in the world do we see a national housing development program providing every citizen the opportunity to own his own house. You created that opportunity for all Singaporeans through your great vision,sound thinking and policies. People may take this for granted but the effort that went into clearing up the villages and kampongs to create a better and modern living conditions for all will not be forgotten Sir. I lived in the era where we had no water and electricity and you changed it all for the people of Singapore .

On the education front fast paced improvements were made to our education system to prepare and equip our young generation for the rapid industrialization and development of our nation. This is no mean feat but a remarkable achievement for our nation.

You are a unique leader in that your aim was for every Singaporean to have a stake in the nation. I and my family consider ourselves blessed to have born and brought up in Singapore and to have witness the Great sacrifices you have contributed to Singapore.

Your succession planning is meticulous. We have a good team in government today and I am very sure that they will make you proud and take care of Singapore in the years ahead.

Rest in Peace Sir.
Your legacy will live on.
Majulah Singapore.

This morning, 27 Mar 2015, I attended the Singapore Community Tribute to Mr Lee Kuan Yew at Kallang Theatre. It was an invitation my sister-in-law extended to me yesterday morning. I thank God for making this possible because I have been feeling uneasy since Mr Lee’s passing on Monday morning.


It is strange that I experienced distress, because I have never met the man or known him on a personal level. I am made in Singapore, born in Singapore and educated in Singapore. In fact, I have been here all my life, loved and aced all my history lessons, yet never quite felt important, unique or patriotic as a Singaporean. On the contrary, I always coveted a foreign education, or to move to a country which is cooler and would perhaps, give my love for writing and the arts a chance to surface. For more than 30 years, I have only been sincerely grateful to my late principal Mrs Margaret Mary Joseph and teachers for shaping my values, my character, my ideals and gifts. My gratitude never went beyond these devoted women from St. Theresa’s Convent, where I had spent close to a decade in.

The first time I felt acquainted with Mr Lee was exactly a month ago, on 27 Feb 2015, after reading his farewell speech to his late wife. It touched me, and broke me, because I know my husband and I will never meet at the same place the way Mr Lee and Mrs Lee did. Their love and respect for each other, and their dependence on each other is what marriage is all about. Many of us are married, but our souls barely ever intertwine with each other. Through the pictures shown of Mr and Mrs Lee, I saw for the first time, Mr Lee as the man next door. In the next few weeks, I read articles written by Lee Wei Ling about her family members. I found myself falling in love with Mr Lee. He was a gentleman of character and wisdom, a romantic partner, a devoted family man and a very responsible and industrious worker. The men in my life do not walk with me; they either walk ahead of me or indulge in their own pleasures and pursuits.

At the tribute this morning, representatives from the Malay, Indian, Eurasian and Chinese community delivered their speech about Mr Lee respectively. The first speaker, Mr Shaikh Syed Isa Semait hobbled up the stage and wobbled off the stage. He wore a long white beard. It suddenly daunted on me that I was seated amongst some of the oldest human beings in Singapore. As I referred to the images of Mr Lee from his prime to his last days, I started to panic. I realised that we are going to lose many of our pioneers within the next decade. It was not until the third speaker Mr Chua Thian Poh spoke, that many of us started to tear. When Mr Lee was 84 years old, he had approached Mr Chua to talk about his worry about Singapore’s competitiveness next to China. It was that year the committee Business China was formed. When he was 88 years old, Mr Lee again approached Mr Chua to discuss his fear that Singapore was going to lose our bilingualism since most families now speak mainly English. To ensure that we remained competitive, he urged Mr Chua to set up the Bilingualism Fund and donated his personal funds of $12 million to get it started. We wept not because he gave $12 million. We wept because we have lost that one man who had loved our country and who had loved us and our future even when he was already so old and frail. Besides my father-in-law who would lose sleep over our interest, Mr Lee is the first man who has touched my spirit in a very special way. I feel so loved and humbled to be the daughter of a father.

In many ways, Mr Lee’s commitment to the nation resonates with what I have been taught as a Theresian – ‘Others before self’. I am sad and ashamed of myself that it has to take his passing to make me proud of my nationality. I am ashamed too because I have been living in the Tanjong Pagar Constituency for more than a decade which Mr Lee represents. Yet, it has to take his passing for me to realise I have never once taken part in any of the community activities, or bothered to know him more intimately. I should have paid him my tribute when he was still alive.

Unless God willing, Singapore’s tropical climate will always be warm and humid. Just as we are born into the world without choice of parentage, we are born into Singapore by God’s will. We cannot control the climate, nor change these facts. We can, however, make the best of what we have, with what we do and how we think, act and behave to make life better in Singapore for ourselves and for our children. We can live our unique Singaporean identity to the fullest. But what exactly constitutes the Singaporean identity? I’d like to attribute it to the spirit of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, whom we endearingly regard the Father of our Nation.

1. Singaporeans always ask what’s in it for Singapore and her future, before asking what’s in it for ourselves.

2. Singaporeans are bilingual. We articulate fluently and confidently in English and a second language.

3. Singaporeans do not depend on obscene vulgarities and violence to make a point. We use our wits, humour and perseverance to make a difference.

4. Singaporeans treat our spouses as our equals and love them as we love ourselves.

5. Singaporeans are devoted to our families.

6. Singaporeans are educated by teachers who are dedicated to groom and discipline us so that we become “strong, robust, rugged, with tremendous qualities of stamina, endurance and at the same time, with great intellectual discipline and most of all, humility and love for our community; a readiness to serve”.

7. Singaporeans do not retire. We live frugally and continue to serve our community and our nation till our last breath.

As Mr Lee Kuan Yew said in one of his parliament speeches, “the only complaint is some lead too much with their minds, and not with their hearts”. “We can have a political divide, but not a national divide.”

I thank Mr Lee Kuan Yew for giving my mother a home to live in. She was chased out of her home when she was a child. I thank Mr Lee for making education possible for me. I thank him for his persistence on having a multiracial society built on equality and meritocracy so that everyone who is born in this mud-flat swamp has an equal chance in life. Because of his foresight, I received a precious convent education led by an extraordinary Indian lady, and a devoted team of Chinese, Malay, Indian and Eurasian teachers. These women embraced the LKY spirit and did their best to give me and my peers the best lessons in life. I am proud to call myself a Singaporean. I am a convent girl, a Theresian and I have a bit of Chinese, Malay, Indian and Eurasian blood in my soul. I am a woman for others, who is made and born in Singapore. And I have the letters ‘L’, ‘K’ and ‘Y’ in my name. I am proud to be Kylie.

Thank you Papa Lee. While I grieve your passing, I am happy for you. Mr Benett Theseiram, the President of the Eurasian Association of Singapore reminded us today that you are released from your failing body into a life with your beloved wife. I will raise my children to speak and write in fluent English and Chinese like you. May God bless your soul and grant you eternal rest in His kingdom.

The Amara Team mourns the loss of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore’s founding father and our Member of Parliament for Tanjong Pagar GRC. Through his vision, selfless conviction and dedication, he rallied like-minded leaders of his pioneering team and those ensuing to build Singapore into a sparkling global hub for Finance, Trade, digital innovations, biomedical sciences, offshore headquarters for global MNCs (OHQs) and Tourism.


Amara as a homegrown company with its humble origins in Tanjong Pagar has benefited from the extraordinary transformation from a third world to a first world economy that he had created for Singapore. We will stay committed to do our part and build upon his legacy and passion for the sustainable growth of Singapore.

With condolences from the management and staff of Amara Holdings Limited.

Thank you Mr Lee Kuan Yew for your vision, dedication to Singapore and the people. You are visionary to fulfill the Singapore dream for many.


I came from Malaysia in 1979 at the age of 13. The excellent education, opportunities and rewards Mr Lee Kuan Yew has envisioned for the people of Singapore became a reality for me and my family. I became a proud Singaporean. Hundreds of thousands must have shared this Singapore dream.

I studied secondary school, junior college, undergraduate and post graduate in Singapore. Rather quickly, I had a good job with a MNC. After some years, I got married with the Singapore girl I love and then later I was posted to the Singapore-Suzhou Industrial Park as a young general manager. I had the wonderful privilege to meet Mr Lee, to shake hand with him and be invited to have a group dinner to brief Mr Lee and gave him feedbacks from the ground. Many complained:- “China don’t know how to do this! China don’t know how to do that!” . Many feedback about how inconvenient to do business there, but we all had a good laugh when Mr Lee candidly pointed out “that’s why Singaporean can have a good job here!”. Mr Lee, at that time, were helping Singapore to grow her international economy and helping Singaporean to grow in our minds to take on the world. Mr Lee knew it would benefit Singapore and the people most when he helped China do business with the west, and in turn helped the west enters China.

Mr Lee Kuan Yew, thank you for leading and guiding us with the best interest of the people of Singapore in mind all your life. You will always be remembered. It is my honor to carry on this spirits of excellence.

Deepest respect,

五十年前, 您为这个小岛国落泪了。
但是因为您的泪水 汗水, 新加坡已经不是从前那落后的小渔村。
五十年后, 新加坡是我们的家园, 而您是守护她的那份安全感。您是我们每日能安安稳稳生活的理由。
虽然我是年轻一代-今年十九岁, 并没有经历什么风寒雨露, 一出生就生活在无忧无虑的新加坡,丰衣足食,但是我很清楚如果没有您的领导,和建国一代的付出, 这一切都不是可能的。没有您, 新加坡也许还是一片沼泽地。我更不可能会有房子住, 有受教育的机会等等。
您的离开, 让我觉得心里突然好像少了些什么。但是我同时知道您和您秉持着的精神将会一直活在我的心中。
五十年后, 我们为您流泪了。我为您流泪了。
我想对您说一声: 谢谢您, 建国总理。我爱您。♥

Mr Lee Kuan Yew, you are the true father of Singapore.

You grew us from a corrupt, dirty and flood-prone third world country to the beauty that is Singapore today. You risked your life, standing up bravely to do what is right when you could have taken the easy way out and remained an English gentleman, a rich lawyer or wealthy businessman. You agonised over Singapore and took many hurts from us when we rejected or mouthed unpleasant words to you – just like what rebellious or ignorant children do to their parents.

You and your team did not give up but persistently soldiered on. Always working for the good of Singapore.

When you achieved absolute power, you could have easily rested on your laurels and started padding your own pockets. Instead, you continued to work hard for Singapore, enhancing its reputation far and wide and at the same time working to educate the rest of us Singaporeans, bringing us up to first world status. You took pains to explain the realities of the world to us, at the same time shielding us from sensitive issues when necessary. It could not have been easy to scatter petals on the grave of the 2 Indonesian terrorist who bombed McDonald House but you did it because you valued what a stable region could do for the future.

Time and again we benefitted from your foresight. Who could realise that the vastly unpopular bilingual policy which you insisted on implementing could yield huge dividends now. We are able not only to participate in China’s growth but India’s future growth as well.

It is sad that some countries are claiming to emulate your policies when they only choose small bits and pieces to implement ( I refer to dictatorships around the world who claimed that authoritarian rule works because you have proven that there is more than one way to achieve success). If they really wanted to follow in your footsteps, they should do everything you do, including the tough parts like removing corruption and uplifting everyone in the country. It is indeed amazing that Singapore is the only country in the world where there are no slumps. Can they do the same ? Do they sincerely want to be authoritarian because that is the way to push the country forward fast or do they just want absolute power ?

I had the opportunity to work in a statutory board for 3 years. I realised that had Singapore not been authoritarian in the beginning, we would not have been able to leap frog so fast into the technological age. However, when it came time, you and your team did not cling on to power but moved to a more consensual style, inviting fellow Singaporeans to serve on committees to map out the next steps / laps. We moved slower but more people understood what had to be done and we all worked together to make it happen.

From what I have seen this past week while the nation was mourning for you, you have succeeded in passing on very valuable attributes to all of us, your children. Many people expected the Singapore stock market and Singapore dollar to drop – however the people you have trained / put in place already anticipated what might happen and the financial markets did not suffer any great upheaval. There are many other instances where the character you have imparted to us your children are shown which I am sure others will mention. From this, I can confidently predict that the Singapore your created will flourish.

My late father told stories of what you and your team did in the early years for Singapore. He really appreciated what you did for them then. Similarly, I will tell of what you have done in my lifetime. You are indeed a great man and we are so fortunate that you decided to dedicate your life to Singapore. Thank you very, very much. We are really, really blessed to have had you in our lives.

You have done a great job !

Rest in peace Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

Rest in peace, we will continue your legacy.

Nobody is perfect and you cannot please everyone…these are the lessons that the late Mr. Lee Kuan Yew has taught me. He has built Singapore and is the founding father of Singapore…that’s a fact that cannot be changed. Thank you for all you have done and for making Singapore your life…rest in peace and you will be greatly missed always…

Dear Mr Lee,
Thank you very much for your fights. The iron in you that brought us to where we are.
You gave us a miracle. You saw the vision, shape our fate and the Singapore we can all call home and be so proud of.
We love and miss you dearly. We will remember your legacy and move ahead strongly – as you have always inspire us.

Rest in peace, our dear Hero.

Goodbye Mr Lee..I thank you for building this successful nation with your life. Because of you, I’m able to read and write in English n Chinese. I’m able to travel to many places without a visa. You will be greatly missed. You will always be remembered deep in our hearts.

寒窗早萌爱国志，仗义助友初啼试。

归国代争工运利，赢得工会竞相持。

组党周旋问政势，终获权放领自治。

正逢国家庆金禧，府里传来坏消息。

国父病倒入院医，牵动全国共许祈。

祈望上苍多怜悯，赐于康复共庆禧。

无奈终归撒手去，留下万民同悲泣。

一生劳心为民情，如今该享长安息。

感恩为吾创美好，必定传承加珍惜。

Dear Mr Lee,
We are thankful for what you have contributed and done for Singapore. Without you, Singapore would not be what it is today – peaceful, prosperous and safe.


Thank you Mr Lee for transforming Singapore from 3rd world country to 1st world country. Without you, Singapore would not be enjoying the success and prosperity. My late parents have high regards and respect for you – for what you have done for Singapore.

We will always remember you, our founding father of Singapore. May you rest in peace.

My family and I have been indelibly touched by Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s brilliance of mind, excellence of heart and foresight. He has become a legend in our lifetime.
As an 80-year old, I bore witness to the early years of turbulence and unrest, and controversial policies. Despite this, I have been and will always remain an ardent supporter and strong defender of Mr Lee Kuan Yew against his harshest critics amongst acquaintances, family, friends and even strangers.


In life Mr Lee Kuan Yew built a nation, the best in ASEAN, if not the World. In death, he united a nation in mourning.
May this present generation of leaders step up with the same spirit and determination to serve Singapore.
May Mr Lee Kuan Yew rest in peace.
From a very grateful Vincent Chia and Family
Mr Vincent Chia

Thank you, Mr Lee. Thank you for devoting your life to building this nation, for giving so many of us a place we are proud and want to call home, and for the many silent sacrifices that you and your family must have made that we are not even aware of.


I was at the Parliament House on 26 Mar with my parents. I was very moved to see Singaporeans (and even some non-Singaporeans, I believe) from all walks of life, young and old, willingly joining the long queues (stretching for hours) to pay their last respects, without any complaints. This just shows that we have truly benefited from your work and are genuinely grateful for it. (And I wish this is sufficient enough for the foreign press to stop their self-righteous campaigning for an oppressed people that they have imagined us to be.)

I see no ‘ugly’ Singaporeans in the queues. Instead, I see people giving out bottles of water, reminding others to keep themselves hydrated in the hot weather. I see people giving out umbrellas and recipients asking how they could return them (no one is looking out for freebies; instead we just want to ensure that another person gets a chance to be shielded from the blazing sun). I see ushers actively looking out for the elderly and those with special needs. I see hope. I see an outpouring of emotions and gratitude online. I see the moderate ‘silent’ majority finally standing up when the occasion calls for it and voicing against biased views.

And I hope that after this week of national mourning, we will continue to remember the sacrifices our founding fathers have made. If each one of us, in our little ways, can each do something in our lifetime that benefits at least one other fellow Singaporean, we may just be able to extend this miracle of a tiny red dot against odds.
Wee Ling

Dear Sir,


I write this with a heavy heart. Thanks for your numerous contributions to Singapore.

I have benefited from your vision of creating a meritocratic Singapore, where personal success depends on hard work, not race or class. I, too, have great respect for you and your team in creating a clean, safe and prosperous Singapore. Thanks for being part of the fearless team of leaders that created the Singapore that I am proud to call home, 10000 miles away. Rest in peace.

一个时代的英雄, 一个伟大的领袖, 一个深情的丈夫, 一个严厉的父亲, 他真的走了。建国道路一路走来辛苦了。肩负着几白万人民的生命与幸福, 您一路带领着我们迈向成功的道路, 谢谢您为我们开创了一条康庄大道, 开启了幸福之门。您一生的奉献造就了今日的新加坡。您的智慧, 勇气和坚韧不拔的精神是我们的典范。您传奇的一生将名垂青史 万古流芳。我们会延续您的精神让新加坡继续发光发热。虽然有很多的不舍, 希望您一路走好。永别了我们的建国总理, 我们的父亲。 安息吧。
