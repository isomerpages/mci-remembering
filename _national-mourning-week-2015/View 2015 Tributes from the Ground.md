#### Remembering Lee Kuan Yew – The Nation’s Farewell

The Funeral Service for Singapore’s Founding Prime Minister was held at the National University of Singapore’s University Cultural Centre on 29 Mar 2015. The nation came together as one to say its final goodbye to Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

#### Acts of kindness: Community spirit continues to run high

Singaporeans have continued to show their generosity and kindness throughout this mourning period for the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

Mr Jasper Tan, YEO’s sales representative, made it a point to involve his children – 8-year-old Seth and 7-year-old Shain-ann – in the distribution of drinks and bottled water to those waiting in line on the third day of the Lying-in-State. Students from the Anglo-Chinese Junior College also did their part in handing out drinks and food at the Padang.
