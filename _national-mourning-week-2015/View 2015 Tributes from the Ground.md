##### Remembering Lee Kuan Yew – The Nation’s Farewell

The Funeral Service for Singapore’s Founding Prime Minister was held at the National University of Singapore’s University Cultural Centre on 29 Mar 2015. The nation came together as one to say its final goodbye to Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

#### Acts of kindness: Community spirit continues to run high
Singaporeans have continued to show their generosity and kindness throughout this mourning period for the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
Mr Jasper Tan, YEO’s sales representative, made it a point to involve his children – 8-year-old Seth and 7-year-old Shain-ann – in the distribution of drinks and bottled water to those waiting in line on the third day of the Lying-in-State. Students from the Anglo-Chinese Junior College also did their part in handing out drinks and food at the Padang.

Maybank employees also contributed by  giving out more than 4,000 bottles of water. Vitagen also provided chilled drinks on Cavenagh Bridge to help the people in line cope with the heat while waiting in line. Staff from Tiong Bahru Bakery and BreadTalk helped relieve their hunger pangs.

Many other unsung heroes also helped ensure that the place remained clean. A member of public was seen voluntarily picking up litter at the Padang, an endeavour which Youth Corps Singapore’s volunteers also took on. Workers, such as staff from SMRT, technicians and cleaners from Hong Lim Park, also worked tirelessly through the night to help make the wait more comfortable.

**Businesses are also doing their part.**

As a tribute to our nation’s founding father and “in loving memory of his lifelong dedication towards the development of Singapore”, Grabtaxi is donating $1 for every ride completed with the code, “thankyouLKY” throughout this period of national mourning.  According to GrabTaxi’s Facebook posting, the donations will go to the MOE’s Education Fund and NTUC-U CareFund. Local entrepreneurs are also exercising their creativity and providing members of public with various ways in which they can pay tribute to Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

The vigil guards is the nation’s highest form of respect given to the deceased. It is made up of uniformed officers from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Police. They will stand  solemnly in formation – four on each corner of the casket, and one senior officer at the head of it facing inwards.
They will stand guard round the clock  as the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew lies in state at the Parliament House,  their heads slightly bowed, making no eye contact with anyone,  their swords inverted.

Every 30 minutes, the four guards near the casket will change shifts. There are 60 vigil guards in total.
We manage to get some of the Vigil guards who are getting ready to relieve their colleagues to share with us their emotional experience.

Companies also took the initiative to create their own tribute sites to honour the late Mr Lee. Below are some pictures from these tribute sites.

They may have not experienced first-hand the trying times of Singapore’s building years. Yet they came to pay tribute to Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

Across the island, young children have been visiting community sites to pen tribute messages for Mr Lee, a man they have only read about in books or heard about from their parents and teachers.

This young girl came with her parents to thank Mr Lee. When she arrived, observers saw her rush to the board and tip-toe to pick up a marker. Without hesitation, she proceeded to draw a circle bigger than her heart and penned a message to Mr Lee.

This is what she said:

“Dear Mr Lee, Thank you for everything I have today, my flat, my education, my famili/s (sic) peaceful times when everywhere in this world people worry about basic necessities. I am the first in my family to be able to complete my education and is the first graduate, to my parents who are near illiterate. Thank you for changing our lives.”


Mr Lee Kuan Yew not only touched the lives of Singaporeans, but also the lives of many who came to work in Singapore. Upon hearing of Mr Lee’s passing, these former workers set up their own tribute site back in Tamil Nadu, India, to pay their respects.

Sometimes, pictures are just not enough to capture the emotions on the ground. We took the opportunity to do a “From the Ground” series capturing the raw emotions as the public brave queues to pay their last respects to Mr Lee.

Find out what Singaporeans of all ages and walks of life have to say as we put them on camera.

#### Paying Tribute to One Man in Diverse Ways
The widely-familiar image of a black ribbon framing Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s profile has birthed car decals, badges, T-shirt logos, stickers and more. Created by Member of Parliament Alex Yam and his team, the logo was also printed on 1,000 customised balloons, produced by a group of Singaporeans and Singapore Permanent Residents who were brought together by a common sense of grief and a wish to honour the late Mr Lee. The passing of founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew saw a nation coming together to both honour and mourn, in a myriad of manner and form. It would not be possible to put together an exhaustive list of tributes conceptualised and paid; the following are but some of the highlights.

#### A Final Send-off: Crowds Line State Funeral Procession Route
The skies opened and heavy rain fell on the crowds lining the State Funeral procession route. However, they were not deterred and stayed put, determined to bid a final farewell to Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Heeding the calls to dress in either black or white, members of public at the Padang armed themselves with umbrellas and ponchos and waited patiently in the downpour for the departure of the gun carriage bearing Mr Lee’s casket from Parliament House. Thousands lined the streets from St Andrews Road to Shenton Way, Cantonment Road to Clementi Road, bearing the Singapore flag in an emotional send-off.

Even as the rain poured, Singaporeans braved the elements, lining the streets to catch a glimpse of the funeral procession and gathering at various Community Tribute Sites with their fellow Singaporeans to witness the State Funeral Service for Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

The mood was sombre as the cortege made its way to the University Cultural Centre, where 10 eulogies were delivered. Many could not hold back their tears as the nation bids its final farewell to the leader who built Singapore.

Tributes continued to flow in even during the final moments.

The week of national mourning saw Singaporeans across all ages and races, and from all walks of life come together to celebrate Mr Lee’s lifetime of achievements, grieve for his passing and relive moments of our history.
In his passing, Mr Lee Kuan Yew once again united the nation as only he can. As Singaporeans joined our voices to recite the pledge and sing the national anthem, it is clear that we are more determined than ever to safeguard the legacy that he has left behind.

At the Pasir Ris Punggol Community Tribute Site, one senior who had never had the benefit of a formal education, asked a young volunteer to help her write down her thoughts before she could sign it off. It was a heartfelt tribute to Mr Lee.  Parents encouraged their children to leave words of appreciation, knowing that they would understand the poignancy of Mr Lee’s passing and his immense contributions to Singapore, in time to come.

Paying Tribute to Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s Role in Building a Harmonious Society

While Mr Lee Kuan Yew was Lying-in-State, religious and community leaders came together to remember Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s legacy in promoting harmony between different races and faiths.
 
Archbishop William Goh led a 5000-strong Catholic community in a mass at St. Joseph’s Church on Friday to pay tribute to Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Archbishop Goh noted that Mr Lee had a deep respect for people of all faiths and was a staunch advocate of inter-religious dialogue, although he professed himself an agnostic.

In his Friday sermon at Muhajirin Mosque, Uztaz Irwan Hadi Md Shuhaimy said that Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his team worked hard to develop Singapore into a prosperous country. This was achieved through the harmonious relationship between people of different races, economic development and an excellent education system.
 
Minister for Communications and Information Dr Yaacob Ibrahim, who was also at the mosque for the Friday prayers, said that Mr Lee was always very concerned about what was happening with the Malay-Muslim community and would always ask “What more can be done?”
Over 2000 worshippers took part in a prayer session organised by the Singapore Buddhist Federation at the Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery on Thursday.

As our nation grieves, each and every written tribute bears testimonial to how Mr Lee has touched our lives and built an extraordinary country, a legacy that would be honoured by generations to come.

Nee Soon lit up in memory of Mr Lee Kuan Yew last night (27 March, Friday).
In a special memorial event, more than 15,000 people from all walks of life, from all over Singapore, including Minister K Shanmugam and fellow Nee Soon MPs, paid tribute to our founding father.

They came, they said their thanks, they cried.

Some wore their hearts on their sleeves. Others kept a brave and stoic front. But it was clear that Mr Lee touched the lives of all who came.

Candles were lit to form a picture of our island, with a portrait of Mr Lee in the middle. Each candle signified the gratitude that some found hard to articulate, and their love for a country which they call home.
![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/tributes-from-the-ground/neesoon3.png)
 
It was a heartfelt and meaningful event.

Mr Lee fought for his fellow Singaporeans and gave his life so that we could dare to dream and hope for a better future, so that our children could have a better home and a better life.

He may no longer be with us, but his light will continue shining brightly in Singapore.
