### Winning the ground  ###

The run-up to merger with Malaysia was a bitter period. The PAP and the Barisan Socialis waged a fierce struggle for the hearts and minds of Singaporeans. This struggle led to the Trades Union Congress also splitting into the Barisan-affiliated Singapore Association of Trade Unions (SATU) and the PAP-affiliated National Trades Union Congress (NTUC).
