Mr Lee understood the vulnerability of small states such as Singapore, and believed that “a small country must seek a maximum number of friends, while maintaining the freedom to be itself as a sovereign and independent nation”.


Together with Mr S Rajaratnam, Singapore’s first Foreign Minister, Mr Lee moved quickly to boost the country’s standing on the international stage.
