### Opening his first ###

“Soon you will have to decide on your future. In the next few months we shall settle the constitutional arrangements for merger. In this series of broadcasts, I hope to tell you what merger means, why it is good for all of us, why it is coming, and why some people are deliberately creating trouble and difficulty over it to prevent it from taking place.” 

– Opening his first “Battle For Merger” broadcast, 13 September 1961
