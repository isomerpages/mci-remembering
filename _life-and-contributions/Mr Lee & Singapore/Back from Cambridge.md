### Back from Cambridge ###

Back in Singapore in August 1950, Mr Lee was offered pupillage at law firm Laycock &amp; Ong. Its senior partner, John Laycock, was a member of the pro-British Singapore Progressive Party. When Laycock asked Mr Lee to become his election agent in the 1951 Legislative Council campaign, he saw how detached colonial politics was from the lives of most people.


On 1 September 1955, he co-founded the law firm Lee &amp; Lee with his wife, Choo, and brother Dennis.
