### Love everlasting ###

Mr Lee may have been the architect of modern Singapore, but he was also a loving and devoted husband, father, grandfather, brother and son.


Interviews with Mr Lee in his later years revealed softer dimensions of his personality.


When Mrs Lee passed away on 2 October 2010, Singaporeans caught a glimpse of the overwhelming love he felt for his wife and the profound grief he experienced on her passing. When she became bedridden after a series of strokes, he was her daily bedside companion, reading aloud her favourite poems or telling her about his day.


In his eulogy at his wifeâ€™s funeral, Mr Lee said that he had precious memories of their 63 years together. Without Choo, he said, he would have been a different man, with a different life.
