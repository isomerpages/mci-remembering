# First internal government #

The PAP won 43 out of the 51 seats it contested in the 1959 elections. Singapore's first fully-elected government was sworn into office at City Hall on 5 June 1959. Mr Lee became Singaporeâ€™s first Prime Minister, a position he would hold for 31 years until he stepped down in 1990.
