### Internal running of affairs ###

Constitutional talks with Britain on Singapore’s future began in April 1955. Among the All-Party delegates at the talks was Mr Lee.


The British agreed to grant Singapore internal self-government in 1959. A local head of state (Yang di-Pertuan Negara) would replace the British Governor; a 51-member Legislative Assembly would be chosen entirely by popular vote; and a Prime Minister would lead the government.


Though the British would remain in control of foreign affairs and defence, Mr Lee saw self-government as a step towards merger and Merdeka, or independence.


The date for the election of Singapore’s first internal government was set for 30 May 1959.
