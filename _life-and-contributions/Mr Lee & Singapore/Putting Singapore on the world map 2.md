Between 1959 and 2012, Mr Lee made at least 304 official trips to 83 countries. A world-class strategic thinker whose insights were sought by world leaders, he was instrumental in forging a place for Singapore in the international arena.


Singapore was admitted to the United Nations on 21 September 1965. Less than two years later, on 8 August 1967, it became one of the five founding members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
