# Graduation and marriage #

Mr Lee and Miss Kwa graduated from Cambridge on 21 June 1949 with first-class honours, with Mr Lee receiving the only star for distinction in the final Law Tripos II honours list. They were both called to the Bar at Middle Temple on 21 June 1950.


Eager to start their new life together, the couple had tied the knot in secret at Stratford-upon-Avon on 23 December 1947.


They held a second public ceremony on 30 September 1950 after they returned to Singapore.
