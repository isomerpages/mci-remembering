### Launch of the National Orchid Garden ###

"Even in the sixties, when the Government had to grapple with grave problems of unemployment, lack of housing, health and education, I pushed for the planting of trees and shrubs. I have always believed that a blighted urban jungle of concrete destroys the human spirit. We need the greenery of nature to lift up our spirits.” 

– At the launch of the National Orchid Garden, 20 October 1995
