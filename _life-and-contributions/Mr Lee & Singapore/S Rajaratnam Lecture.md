### S Rajaratnam Lecture ###

"Friendship, in international relations, is not a function of goodwill or personal affection. We must make ourselves relevant so that other countries have an interest in our continued survival and prosperity as a sovereign and independent nation.” 

– At the S. Rajaratnam Lecture at Shangri-La Hotel, 9 April 2009.
