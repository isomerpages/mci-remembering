# First union work #

Mr Leeâ€™s political activism began in 1952, when he successfully represented the Postal and Telecommunications Uniformed Staff Union in its negotiations with the colonial government for a salary revision. His shrewd and moderate approach won praise from the press and earned him the respect of workers.


Within just two years, he became legal advisor to more than 100 different unions and associations.


By then, Mr Lee and his comrades such as Goh Keng Swee and Dr Toh Chin Chye were convinced that the unions were key in mobilising a mass base for the anti-colonial struggle.
