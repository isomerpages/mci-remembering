### Sparks of nationalism ###

While in England, Mr Lee joined the Malayan Forum, an anti-colonial student body that was started by Goh Keng Swee and others. He also cut his teeth campaigning, delivering speeches in support of his friend David Widdicombe, a British Labour Party candidate in the 1950 British general election.


Mr Lee left England believing firmly that Singaporeans and Malayans should govern themselves.
