### A remarkable statesman ###

Mr Lee had an extraordinary grasp of the worldâ€™s political and economical trends. Many political and business leaders continued to seek his insights even after he stepped down as premier.


His sharpness of mind and candour, as well as the depth of his political experience, gained him an influence that was altogether disproportionate for a leader of such a small state as Singapore.
