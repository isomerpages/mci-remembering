### 	A lifelong romance 

Mr Lee met Miss Kwa Geok Choo while they were at Raffles College. She was an outstanding student who outdid him in several subjects. He struck up a friendship with Miss Kwa.It was the start of an extraordinary and touching love story that spanned more than half a century.

The couple had an emotional farewall when Mr Lee sailed for England in September 1946. But they were soon reunited after she was awarded the Queen's Scholarship and joined him at Cambridge in 1947 to read law.
