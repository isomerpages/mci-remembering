Immerse in the critical moment of our nation’s history in 1961 as you listen to excerpts of, then Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s series of radio talks in 1961 where he exposed the communists in Singapore – who they were, how they operated and what their aims were. The story of Singapore’s founding years is one that will intrigue both young and old. Presented by the National Library Board and the Singapore Memory Project, there will also be a display of tributes collected during the National Mourning week.

Through the use of images captured by photographers on the ground, A Moment of Unity reflects upon the coming together of Singaporeans and the indomitable spirit they showed during the week of mourning. Rain features as a central element, serving as a recollection of the downpour that marked the State Funeral Procession on 29 March 2015.  <br><br><u>We Built a Nation </u><br>Singapore’s Golden Jubilee is an opportunity for Singaporeans to reflect on our history and the contributions of the pioneer generation of leaders in the early independence years. Through a selection of more than 100 artefacts, many never seen before, and archival images and documents, this exhibition explores the leadership of Singapore’s first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and his team who laid the foundations for modern Singapore. <br><br>The exhibition is dedicated to an exploration of the first ten pivotal years of independence (1965–1975) that shaped Singapore’s history, and the important roles played by the founding leaders in developing Singapore’s economy, foreign policy and diplomacy, security and defence, education and infrastructure. It pays tribute to Lee Kuan Yew’s contributions to Singapore, and the ideals and convictions that shaped him and his generation of leaders.<br> <br>Highlights include artefacts from a major donation from the Estate of Lee Kuan Yew, recently declassified material from Dr Goh Keng Swee from the National Archives of Singapore, as well as donations and loans from the families of many of the founding leaders.    |
| **"The Parliament in Singapore History" Exhibition"**   | **Venue**: The Arts House(1 Old Parliament Lane, Singapore 179429) <br>**Date**: 23 Mar 2016        | The Arts House is presenting a fresh narrative of the varied career path of its building. This new narrative display charts the history of The Arts House from 1827 to 1999. View the story of a house that has witnessed the birth of a nation as well as the development of a legislature that has contributed to Singapore’s growth and progress as a multi-cultural parliamentary democracy. Through rare archival images and spoken words of pioneer Parliamentarians such as Singapore's founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, Dr Goh Keng Swee and Mr S Rajaratnam, the exhibition captures the spirit of our nation-building journey. The oldest government and public building in the Republic, the most significant years of The Arts House must have been those between 1965 and 1999. During this period, this neo-classical colonial building was the seat of independent Singapore’s Parliament, where important historical milestones were planted. Here, our political pioneers and nation builders deliberated key issues that were to chart the path of Singapore’s development, and to define the style of our politics.      |
