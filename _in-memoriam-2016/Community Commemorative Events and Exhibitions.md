Immerse in the critical moment of our nation’s history in 1961 as you listen to excerpts of, then Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s series of radio talks in 1961 where he exposed the communists in Singapore – who they were, how they operated and what their aims were. The story of Singapore’s founding years is one that will intrigue both young and old. Presented by the National Library Board and the Singapore Memory Project, there will also be a display of tributes collected during the National Mourning week. Beyond an expression of grief and loss, these tributes reflect our gratitude towards the late Mr Lee.      |
