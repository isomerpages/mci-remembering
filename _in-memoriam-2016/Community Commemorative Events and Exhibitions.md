Immerse in the critical moment of our nation’s history in 1961 as you listen to excerpts of, then Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s series of radio talks in 1961 where he exposed the communists in Singapore – who they were, how they operated and what their aims were. The story of Singapore’s founding years is one that will intrigue both young and old. Presented by the National Library Board and the Singapore Memory Project, there will also be a display of tributes collected during the National Mourning week. Beyond an expression of grief and loss, these tributes reflect our gratitude towards the late Mr Lee.      |

Through the use of images captured by photographers on the ground, A Moment of Unity reflects upon the coming together of Singaporeans and the indomitable spirit they showed during the week of mourning.

Through a selection of more than 100 artefacts, many never seen before, and archival images and documents, this exhibition explores the leadership of Singapore’s first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and his team who laid the foundations for modern Singapore. <br><br>The exhibition is dedicated to an exploration of the first ten pivotal years of independence (1965–1975) that shaped Singapore’s history, and the important roles played by the founding leaders in developing Singapore’s economy, foreign policy and diplomacy, security and defence, education and infrastructure. It pays tribute to Lee Kuan Yew’s contributions to Singapore, and the ideals and convictions that shaped him and his generation of leaders.<br> <br>Highlights include artefacts from a major donation from the Estate of Lee Kuan Yew, recently declassified material from Dr Goh Keng Swee from the National Archives of Singapore, as well as donations and loans from the families of many of the founding leaders.    |
