### Tributes to Mr Lee - 1 Year On


Dear Sir. I dedicate this song "winds of change" to you. Rest in peace.
Forever in Singapore's memory.
*The world is closing in
Did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers
The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change*

**Dianna**


"I don't think you should die until you're ready. Until you've wrung out every last bit of living you can."
You Sir. have done your best for Singapore. Thank you. RIP

Sir, coming to one year of your departure. 23 March 2015 was a day forever remember in the heart of the Singaporeans. We are greatly indebted to the old guards of your team for the comfort we enjoy today.

You deserve a huge thank you for being such a wonderful and wise person. You have helped and inspired many of us to do the things that we only dreamed of doing.

Without you, Singapore would not be what it is today!

"Out of the dusk, a rainbow we shall see tomorrow."

With loving kindness

Terima Kasih Mr Lee. Rakyat Singapura amat terhutang budi kepada anda.

Thank you Mr Lee. My family and I were given opportunities by the government to improve ourselves and make a better living. My mum may be a dishwasher (and I am terribly proud of her), but today I am a senior nurse with a degree in hospital care. My daughter is currently pursuing her masters in aeronautical science. Everything happens for a reason and i thank the Allah s.w.t for all HIS blessings. Mr Lee, your policies to a large extend helped be where i am today. Thank you and may our future leaders always keep your values and ideals in their mind and hearts.

Sir, one year has passed in a flash and we are ever grateful for your sacrifices and devotion to our nation. May we always remember your sacrifices and continue the legacy that you have left. Gone but not forgotten.

**Benson Kong**

Rest in peace Mr Lee. Will be visiting all your exhibitions to find out more about your legacy in Singapore over this weekend. Should be interesting. Just hope that the crowd would not be too bad...

**Cassandra Tan**


One year has passed. We spent National Day without you. We missed you. Singapore survived despite the many challenges, We will always remember that you fought for Singapore. Thank you.

**Jenny liew**


You are deeply missed Mr Lee. If only you can celebrate the SG50 with us last year...

**Zhi Wei Chew**

I went down to pen my tribute at your Tanjong Pagar constituency. Still cannot believe that you have left us. Rest in peace Mr Lee. We will uphold that values that you championed during your lifetime for our children and their childens' children

Hi Sir! Tomorrow marks the first death anniversary of our beloved Mr Lee Kuan Yew. He is deeply missed by every Singaporean including myself. Although I am not that talented to do anything special in tribute of Mr Lee, I am very proud of the fellow Singaporeans who were creative and sincere in doing so! One of them who caught my eyes is Reuby, who composed and wrote this song as a tribute to Mr Lee, for all his contributions and love for Singapore and Singaporeans.

Last year this time, when Mr Lee left us, Reuby and his team were in Hong Kong taking part in a singing competition. He dedicated his award to Mr Lee as he wasn’t able to make it back in time to bade farewell. 前人种樹，後人乘涼; my generation including people like Reuby benefited so much from the hard work of Mr Lee and his team and all our forefathers.

On this day, I wished that younger Singaporeans will learn to appreciate what we have, to continue building our country with love and hard work just like what Mr Lee had done all his life. Please feel free to share this song [Legendary] with all fellow Singaporeans!

**Kammy**


Forever in loving memory. Rest in Peace. We will continue to preserve you ideals

**John Peh**


A year has gone by since your passing, yet there are times when we wonder if this is a reality. The constant questions on my mind were: Have we moved on and taken his dream to future heights? Have we done our part to contribute back to the very Singapore he built with his blood, sweat and tears? Only we ourselves and our future generations can answer that.
I am truly grateful for the many opportunities in my life that were a result of his hard work. Thank you once again Mr Lee, rest in peace.

Dear Sir, It's almost 1 year past your passing, you were still well remembered for your great contributions. Thank you very much once again and shall try to live to the ideal you had for Singapore. May God bless you, and that your soul is resting in peace.

With greatest respect,

Our memory still lives on but we cannot forget what Mr Lee has done for Singapore. Singaporeans should be proud and fly our flag high. We must stand united as one people to build a prosperous nation.
Thank You Mr Lee we miss you.

**Denson Joseph**


Dear Sir, Time really flies, it is already 1 year since you have passed on. Greatly missed your presence in Parliament and your powerful speeches that never failed to hit home the message you want to send : ) I hope that the ministers that you have hand picked will carry on the values and teachings to ensure Singapore continues to shine and be sustainable in this chaotic and uncertain world. May you and Mrs Lee watch over Singapore from the other world. Thank you very much : )

**CHEW**


Mr Lee. You were gone too soon. We have accomplished so much within this 50 years that it is now more important than ever to defend it for the future generations.
Rest in Peace Mr Lee.

**Alroy**

Mr Lee, thank you for giving your all to Singapore. I will have a son in two months time and i will definitely be sharing with him that Singapore should never be taken for granted.
Thank you for everything again Mr Lee. Rest in Peace.

**Marcus Ley**


Mr Lee. Of all your contributions to Singapore. The best you did was to strive for a multiracial harmony and a meritocratic society. As a result, i have married a malay lady (i am a chinese) and i now work as a senior engineer even though i entered as an apprentice.
You values for Singapore has changed lives and i (and the rest of singapore) am forever greatful. Rest in peace Mr Lee.
