### Tributes to Mr Lee - 1 Year On


Dear Sir. I dedicate this song "winds of change" to you. Rest in peace.
Forever in Singapore's memory.
*
The world is closing in
Did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers
The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change*

**Dianna**


"I don't think you should die until you're ready. Until you've wrung out every last bit of living you can."
You Sir. have done your best for Singapore. Thank you. RIP

Nicola Huay


Sir, coming to one year of your departure. 23 March 2015 was a day forever remember in the heart of the Singaporeans. We are greatly indebted to the old guards of your team for the comfort we enjoy today.

You deserve a huge thank you for being such a wonderful and wise person. You have helped and inspired many of us to do the things that we only dreamed of doing.

Without you, Singapore would not be what it is today!

"Out of the dusk, a rainbow we shall see tomorrow."

With loving kindness

Dave Kaelan Heng
