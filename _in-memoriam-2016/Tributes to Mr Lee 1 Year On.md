### Tributes to Mr Lee - 1 Year On


Dear Sir. I dedicate this song "winds of change" to you. Rest in peace.
Forever in Singapore's memory.
*The world is closing in
Did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers
The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change*

Sir, coming to one year of your departure. 23 March 2015 was a day forever remember in the heart of the Singaporeans. We are greatly indebted to the old guards of your team for the comfort we enjoy today.

You deserve a huge thank you for being such a wonderful and wise person. You have helped and inspired many of us to do the things that we only dreamed of doing.

Without you, Singapore would not be what it is today!

"Out of the dusk, a rainbow we shall see tomorrow."

With loving kindness

Thank you Mr Lee. My family and I were given opportunities by the government to improve ourselves and make a better living. My mum may be a dishwasher (and I am terribly proud of her), but today I am a senior nurse with a degree in hospital care. My daughter is currently pursuing her masters in aeronautical science. Everything happens for a reason and i thank the Allah s.w.t for all HIS blessings. Mr Lee, your policies to a large extend helped be where i am today. Thank you and may our future leaders always keep your values and ideals in their mind and hearts.

Sir, one year has passed in a flash and we are ever grateful for your sacrifices and devotion to our nation. May we always remember your sacrifices and continue the legacy that you have left. Gone but not forgotten.
